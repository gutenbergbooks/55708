<blockquote>
<p>'The story has an extraordinary charm, imagination, style.
The descriptions of the German soldiers passing the park gates
on their way to Paris, of the old Corporal of the Grand Army,
drunken and broken-hearted, of the gentle figure of the poor
young count, these belong to literature, and literature of a fine
quality.'&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>'It is a fascinating romance.'&mdash;<i>Punch.</i></p>

<p>'Weird mystery and delicate fancy mingle in "Pierrot." Mr
Stacpoole writes gracefully and his manner suits his dainty
theme.'&mdash;<i>Black and White.</i></p>

<p>'Mr Stacpoole has achieved a distinct success. He has
managed to create just the atmosphere of poetic mystery that
is required, and this it is which gives the book its charm.'&mdash;<i>National
Observer.</i></p>

<p>'If all the volumes of Mr John Lane's new "Pierrot Library"
are to be of the same genus as the first one, "Pierrot," let us
have a volume once a week and regularly as Sunday comes
round.'&mdash;<i>Woman.</i></p>

<p>'On the whole "Pierrot" is both unusual and refreshing.'&mdash;<i>Literary
World.</i></p>

<p>'The story is peculiarly fascinating. The writer has a deft
touch and a rare command of apt language.'&mdash;<i>Dundee Advertiser.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> almost forgotten James Wilder's
existence, when, one night in June, I received
an urgent message asking me to call upon
him without delay.</p>

<p>An hour later I was sitting in his library,
and in the arm-chair opposite mine was
sunk what seemed the spectre of my friend.
During the ten months that had elapsed
since our last meeting he had passed from
middle life to premature old age.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come," he said,
"I am in need of a friend, but do not speak
to me yet, that is, for a moment, I wish to
think."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>His eyes fell from me to the carpet, he
seemed watching something, and his thin
lips were curled in a ghostly smile.</p>

<p>The room was hot and oppressive, flowers
were heaped everywhere in profusion, and
the large wood fire burning in the grate
mixed its faint aromatic smell with the
perfume of the roses and tube-roses lolling
in their porcelain bowls.</p>

<p>I sat watching the burning logs and
thinking. I had known Wilder for some
years, I had been his intimate friend, but
how much did I know really about him?
Not much. I had dined with him, talked
with him, exchanged opinions; I knew that
he was wealthy, that he owned a house somewhere
in the country, to which he never
invited friends, and of which I had heard
rumours needless to set down here. That
he was an opium eater I knew, and that
was the extent of my knowledge of the
man.</p>

<p>Of the being who existed behind that
careworn, weary face, I knew absolutely
nothing, but I had always guessed it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
occupied with some secret trouble, pressed
upon by some sin or sorrow of which it
dared not speak; also, by some freak of
imagination, I had always coupled this
imaginary sorrow of Wilder's with that
house in the country of which I had received
so many mysterious hints.</p>

<p>Suddenly I started from my reverie.
Wilder was speaking.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear &mdash;&mdash;, I have been trying
to brace myself for the effort, but I cannot,
I cannot; what I have to ask of you, you
will do without question if you are my
friend, but to speak of it all, to go over that
terrible ground, oh! impossible, impossible,
impossible."</p>

<p>His voice died away into a whisper, and
he struck with his thin hand on the arm of
his chair, as if beating time to some dreary
tune heard by him alone.</p>

<p>"What I ask of you is this, to start as
soon as possible for my place in Yorkshire,
and to see carried out after the fashion
I desire, the obsequies of a man&mdash;I mean,
a woman&mdash;who is lying there dead."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Again his voice sank to a whisper, his
eyes turned from mine evasively, and he
covered them with one of his thin white
hands.</p>

<p>A man&mdash;I mean a woman&mdash;what <i>did</i> he
mean?</p>

<p>"Will you do this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will do as you ask; it seems
strange, no matter, I will do it."</p>

<p>"You take a load from me. Ah, my dear
----, if you could only guess what I have
suffered, the terrors, the tortures, the <i>nameless</i>
misery. I ought to be at the grave
side when this terrible burial&mdash;Oh, how my
head wanders, I have scarcely the power
of thought, but say it once again, you will
do what I ask, promise me that again."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I promise, set your mind at rest&mdash;I
will do what you require."</p>

<p>"You will start, then, at once?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow early, to-morrow early;
and now as to what you are to do. Listen,
at Ashworth, near my place, there lives a
man who works in granite, you will get him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to cut a memorial tablet. These words are
to be upon it, they are written on this piece
of paper, take it; the body is to be buried in
the vault of the little church in the park;
remember it is to be interred dressed exactly
as I have ordered it to be dressed, this is
my chief reason for asking you to attend
the last ceremonies. I dare not leave this
matter to the hands of servants, and I&mdash;may
not go myself, I am broken down with
ill-health and sorrow, and the journey would
kill me, though, indeed, I am dying fast
enough."</p>

<p>His eyes were wandering again, as if
following some imaginary spectre about
the room. I looked at the piece of paper,
on it was written&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Sir Gerald Wilder</span>, Knt.<br />
<i>Rest in Peace</i>."</p>

<p>Sir Gerald Wilder! why, a moment ago
he said "a woman." What mystery was
in this? And then, "Rest in Peace," it
sounded like a command.</p>

<p>"The coffin is ordered," broke out Wilder,
suddenly seeming to return to this world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
from the world of his imagination. "The
coffin is made, promise me again, you will
go."</p>

<p>"I will go."</p>

<p>The next morning I started for Ashworth,
in Yorkshire, to fulfil my strange mission.
I had asked no more of Wilder, content to
act without question, which is the first office
of friendship. I started early, and arrived
at Ashworth shortly after three o'clock. A
carriage was waiting to take me to the
Gables. The weather was exquisite, and
the moors over which the white road led
us stretched on either side, far as the eye
could reach, like a rolling sea under the
blue summer sky and hot June sun. The
rocking motion sent me to sleep. When I
woke the wheels were crashing on gravel,
and the carriage was passing swiftly through
a long, dark avenue.</p>

<p>This was, then, the Gables, this great old-fashioned
gloomy house, with a broad portico
supported on fluted granite pillars, facing the
broad park dotted with clumps of trees, so
broad and so far-reaching that the deer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the furthermost parts were reduced to moving
specks.</p>

<p>The door was opened by an ill-looking
servant-maid, whose sour and crabbed face
struck an unpleasant note against the old-fashioned
and romantic surroundings.</p>

<p>The great hall, oak-panelled, and lit by
stained glass windows, hid amongst its other
treasures an echo, whose dreamy voice repeated
my footsteps with a sound like the
pattering of a ghost. I stood for a moment,
my heart absorbing the silence of this place,
so far removed from the spirit of to-day.
The air held something, I know not what,
it seemed like an odour left from the perfumed
robes of Romance.</p>

<p>I heard a sound behind me, and turning,
I saw an old servant man with silvery white
hair. He showed me to my room, and I kept
him whilst I explained fully my business.</p>

<p>He listened respectfully, but like a person
who had ceased to take any interest in life.
When I had finished, I asked him to take
me to the room where the dead person lay.</p>

<p>He led the way down a corridor, opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a door, and stood aside whilst I entered.
I found myself in a bedroom hung with
rose-coloured silk; the window was open,
and through it came the warm evening
breeze and the far-off cawing of rooks.</p>

<p>On the bed I saw a form, but I could
scarcely believe that what I saw was real.
Stretched upon the snow-white coverlet lay
the body of a cavalier, full-dressed in amber
satin doublet and long buff-coloured riding-boots,
his hair long, curling, and black as
night, surrounded a face pale as marble and
beautiful as a woman's. His white right
hand, peeping from its lace ruffle, grasped
the hilt of a sword, his left hand grasped
a silver trumpet. Attached to the trumpet
a crimson silk cord streaked the coverlet
like a thin and tortuous stream of blood.
He seemed to have stepped from the pages
of romance, and to have laid himself down
here to rest. I trembled as I looked, feared
to stir lest he should wake, yet I well knew
him to be dead. I might have fancied myself
in a dream but for the far-off clamour
of the rooks coming through the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
sky outside and the sound of my own heart
beating.</p>

<p>Was it a man? was it a woman? the
face might have done for either, yet it was
the most beautiful face I had ever beheld,
the most romantic, the most pathetic.
Then recollection woke up, and I
shuddered. This, then, was Sir Gerald
Wilder. This form, more beautiful than a
picture, was the sorrow of James Wilder, the
thing that had driven him to opium, the
thing that had broken his heart and crowned
him with premature old age. How? Why?
I dared scarcely think.</p>

<p>I stole from the room. In the passage I
found the old man-servant waiting for me;
he shut the door softly, and I followed him
back to my own room. There I took his
arm and looked in his face.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"I dursn't tell you, sir; oh, sir, my heart be
gone with the sorrow of it all, but if you
wish, I will bring the book that he was
always a-writing in for these months past."</p>

<p>"Yes, get the book, please, at once: no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
thank you, nothing to eat yet, I wish to see
the book first."</p>

<p>He went, and returned with a large, old-fashioned
common-place book, the leaves of
which were covered with writing. It was a
woman's hand.</p>

<p>I took it down stairs, and went with it
into the garden.</p>

<p>There, on a seat in the middle of an
old Dutch garden, very prim, very silent,
where the sunlight fell upon the faces of the
amber and purple pansies, and the great
white carnations shook their ruffles to the
wind with a dreamy and seventeenth century
air, I sat and read this story, written by the
hand of a dead cavalier who craves, through
me, your sympathy for his deathless sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I cannot</span> tell you my story unless I tell
you who I am and what I am. Oh, it is
not for pleasure that I am writing all this
down, but just because I&mdash;must.</p>

<p>My name is Beatrice Sinclair, and I am
the last representative of an old and ruined
family. There were Sinclairs in the time
of King Charles who were great people at
Court&mdash;you must accept the statement, for
I cannot write much about this family of
mine, the very thought of it fills me with
a kind of horror. What would all those
men with long flowing hair, those women
with patches on their faces,&mdash;what would
they say if they could see me, the last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
their race, and could know what I have
been?</p>

<p>Perhaps you guess what I mean, perhaps
you are sneering at me; you can do so if
you please, for I am so very ill that I care
for nothing now, and they say I am dying.
I know now, oh, I know well why an
animal crawls away and hides itself to
die: though I am only twenty-three I know
more about death than those Egyptians
who have been shut up in pyramids alone
with him for a thousand years.</p>

<p>From the window where I am sitting
now, wrapped up in shawls, I can see
the garden; the frost has gone, and I can
see a yellow crocus that has pushed its
head up through the dark, stiff mould. If
it knew what I know of life, it would draw
that head back.</p>

<p>You must think me a very gloomy
person, and indeed just now I am, for I
am thinking of a part of my history of
which I shall not speak, but only hint.</p>

<p>Some time, no matter how long ago, I
was living at the Bath Hotel. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
plenty of clothes and money, and I thought
I was in love. Well, one day I found
myself deserted, I found a letter on the
breakfast table enclosing a blue strip of
paper&mdash;a cheque for two hundred pounds.
I did not scream and tear my hair as a
girl I know said she did when she was
deserted, I believe I laughed.</p>

<p>I went to the theatre that night alone,
and everybody stared at me. I was beautiful
then, I am nearly as beautiful now,
but it was only on that night that I first
fully recognised how beautiful I was, I
could see it in the faces of the men who
looked at me, and in the manner of the
women,&mdash;how women hate one another!
and yet some women have been very good
to me.</p>

<p>Well, when I got home I found supper
waiting for me, and after supper I looked
at myself again in the long pier glass
opposite the fireplace; then a strange feeling
came over me that I had never felt
before, I felt a thirst to be admired, I say
thirst, for it was so, it was really in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
back of my throat that this feeling came,
but it was in my head as well; it was not
the admiration of ordinary people that I
wanted; I craved to see some being as
lovely as myself turn its head to gaze at me.</p>

<p>Oh! my beautiful face, how I loved
you, oh! the nights I have woken up
shivering to think of the dissecting rooms
where they take the bodies of the people
who have no friends.</p>

<p>At the end of six months my two
hundred pounds were nearly gone. I lived
innocently, I lived in a kind of dream.
Men filled me with a kind of horror,
when they looked at me in the streets
I shuddered; I shudder still, and I wonder
why God ever made such a blind and
cruel thing as man.</p>

<p>I moved into furnished rooms: all this
is misty now in my mind. If I had died
then I might never have gone to heaven,
but I would never have seen hell. I got
typhoid fever; my rings lay on the dressing
table, hoops of sapphires and emeralds;
each fortnight a ring went to pay for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
rooms and the doctor, who seemed never
able to cure me.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you much after this, I can
only say that I struggled, mad with pride
and mad with hatred. I starved, but why
should I pain you, and make more sad
a story that is already sad enough?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>JAMES WILDER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is about six months ago. I was in
a very bad way. I was walking along
the south side of Russell Square one day&mdash;the
17th of September I remember now&mdash;and
thinking to myself how I should pay
my landlady the three weeks' rent owing
to her.</p>

<p>Deeply as I was trying to think I could
not help noticing a man coming towards
me, striding along with his hat tilted back
from his forehead, his head in the air, and
looking just like a person walking in his
sleep. I made way to let him pass, then
suddenly I felt him grasp me by the arm
and I heard him say "Ah!"</p>

<p>I knew at once&mdash;how shall I put it&mdash;that
he only wanted to speak to me, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
he had mistaken me for someone he knew,
and as I looked in his face I did not feel
a bit afraid, although his face was strange
enough, goodness knows.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Jane Seymour," I replied, for it was
my name, at least the name I went
under.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, and his hand fell from
my arm. I never saw a person look so disappointed
as he looked just then; I heard
him muttering something like "always the
same, disappointment, death," then he
turned to go, and I broke into tears.</p>

<p>I was hungry and I had no money; he
had seemed almost friendly, and now he
was going&mdash;I could scarcely speak, I
leaned up against the railings, I remember
trying to hide a hole in my glove, for I
had determined on telling him my real
name.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, "Well?"</p>

<p>"My name is Beatrice Sinclair," I
answered; "that is my real name."</p>

<p>Then I stopped crying, for I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
absolutely frightened, <i>such</i> a change came
over this strange man; two large tears ran
down his face, he clasped his hands together
with the fingers across the backs
of each hand, and I thought for one
moment that he was a lunatic, then somehow
I <i>knew</i> that he was not.</p>

<p>"Beatrice Sinclair," he muttered to me
in a low voice, as if afraid of someone else
hearing him, "Beatrice Sinclair, oh, Beatrice!
the time I have been searching for you,
the three weary years, the nights of terror;
but it is over now, thank God! thank God."</p>

<p>I felt very strange as he said all this. I
knew well that this man was not in love
with me; I had no relations, so he could
not be a relation, and yet I knew in a
horribly certain kind of manner that he
knew me, that he had been searching for
me, and&mdash;had found me.</p>

<p>A hansom cab was passing, he hailed it
and we both got in, then I heard him giving
directions to the driver, "No.&mdash;Berkeley
Square," he said, "and drive quick."</p>

<p>"You look pale and sick," that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
only thing he said during our drive. But
the way in which he said it was very queer.
He did not seem in the least to care whether
I was pale or sick, and yet he had seemed
so glad to find me, "Can he be mad after
all?" thought I.</p>

<p>The cab stopped at a large house in
Berkeley Square, and we got out; he gave
the driver half-a-sovereign, and without
waiting for the change went up the steps,
and opened the door with a latch-key;
"Come on," he said, beckoning to me, and
I followed.</p>

<p>We entered a great hall with a floor of
polished oak; I saw jars of flowers standing
here and there, and idols half hidden by
palms and long feathery grasses.</p>

<p>He opened a door and motioned me to
enter a room, and I went in, feeling horrible
in my shabby clothes amongst all this
splendour.</p>

<p>It was a library. He told me to sit down,
and I sat in a great easy-chair, looking
about me whilst he went to a window, and
stood for nearly a minute looking out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
jingling money in his pocket, but not
speaking a word.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, this writing makes my head ache
so, and this cough, cough, cough, that tears
me from morning till night!&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, he stood at the window without
speaking, and I kept trying to hide my
boots under my skirt; but I looked about
me, and noticed everything in the room at
the same time.</p>

<p>The books were all set in narrow bookcases,
and between the bookcases there were
spaces occupied by pictures, and I never
had seen such strange pictures before.
They were just like pictures of ghosts,
beautiful faces nearly all of them, but they
seemed like faces made out of mist, if you
understand me. Over the mantelpiece stood
a portrait of an old man with grey hair, and
on the gold frame of this picture was
written in black letters the name, "Swedenborg."</p>

<p>At last my companion turned from the
window, wheeled a chair close to me, and
sat down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"Now," he said, "I want you to tell me
all you know about your family. I want to
make perfectly sure that you <i>are</i> the person
for whom I have been seeking. Tell me
unreservedly, it will be to your advantage."</p>

<p>He had taken his gloves off now, and I
saw that his hands, very white and delicate-looking,
were absolutely covered with the
most exquisite rings.</p>

<p>"Mine is a very old family," I said.
"We lived once in a castle in the North
of England, Castle Sinclair."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"My father was an officer. He was
very extravagant. He died in India. I
was sent to school in England, then I became
a governess&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You need not tell me the rest," he said,
"I know it. Yes, you are indeed Beatrice
Sinclair." He looked at me in a gloomy
manner. Then "You have spoken frankly,"
he said, "and I shall do the same. My
name is James Wilder."</p>

<p>He paused, and looked at me hard, but
I said nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"Ah!" he continued, "you know nothing
of the past, then? Perhaps it is better so,
but I must tell you some of it, so that you
may do what I require you to do. Listen.
In the reign of King Charles the First a
terrible tragedy happened. A member of
the Wilder family did a fearful wrong upon
a member of the Sinclair family. No family
feud took place, because Gerald Wilder, who
had committed this wrong, expiated it by
suicide, but a blind, reasonless, unintentional
feud has been going on between the two
houses ever since. The house of Sinclair
has warred with our family in a strange
and fearful manner. All the eldest sons of
our house have been slain before the age of
twenty by&mdash;a Sinclair. My eldest brother
was slain by your father's brother."</p>

<p>"My father's brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they were out shooting together.
My brother was shot dead by your uncle.
It was an accident; no one was to blame,
but fate. Now the fortunes of the two
families have been altering during all these
years. The house of Wilder is at its zenith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Speaking in a worldly sense, I am worth
at least fifty thousand a year, at <i>least</i>, and
the house of Sinclair?&mdash;you are its last
representative, how much are you worth?"</p>

<p>"Less than nothing."</p>

<p>"Let us be friends then, let us be friends,"
said Wilder, in a voice full of supplication.
How strange it sounded to hear a man like
this, wealthy and great, asking for <i>my</i> friendship.
"Let us be friends,&mdash;the two last
representatives of these great houses must
forgive each other. Love can heal this
awful wound, and the house of Wilder shall
not be extinct. Oh, God is great and good,
he will sanction this love even though you
are what you are."</p>

<p>He was walking up and down the room
as he spoke. "Does he want me to love
<i>him</i>?" I thought.</p>

<p>Then he stopped.</p>

<p>"You have no money?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>He went to a desk and drew out a
cheque-book, scribbled for a moment, tore
off a cheque, and brought it to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>I looked at it: it was a cheque on the
British Linen Company's Bank for five
hundred pounds. I felt just as if I were
drunk, the books in the cases seemed to
dance.</p>

<p>"This can't be for me," I remember
saying; "or do you want me to do some
dreadful thing, that you offer me all this
money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I stopped, for he was smiling at me such
a melancholy, kind smile, it told me at once
that I had nothing to fear from him. He
called me "child," and took my hand and
kissed it&mdash;I felt so ashamed of my glove,
but he did not seem to notice the holes in
it, nor how old it was.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "the money is for you;
you must buy yourself beautiful clothes and
some jewellery. I am going to send you to
the north of England, to do what has to be
done. You must start on the day after to-morrow;
have no fear, I wish you to do
nothing sinful or wrong, but rather the best
work mortal ever did; you shall be provided
for. I will set aside a fund for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
under trustees; it is an act of piety, not
charity, for in saving the last of the Sinclairs
from want I am doing an act which
may expiate the sin our house committed.
Beatrice Sinclair, you shall never want again,
never be cold or hungry."</p>

<p>I was crying like a child. When I could
cry no more he began speaking again.</p>

<p>"You must stay in this house until you
start, that is, if you please. My carriage
shall take you to all the shops you require
to visit; by the way, spend <i>all</i> that money
on clothes. I will give you a note to the
jewellers with whom I deal in Bond
Street, and you can supply yourself with
all the jewellery you require; don't think
about the expense. You are beautiful by
nature, but I wish you to be as beautiful as
art can make you. Then, again, you will
require dressing-bags and portmanteaux, and
such things. I will give you a note to the
best firm in London. I need not speak to
you on matters of taste; you are a lady&mdash;I
only say this, spare no expense. Is that
cheque sufficient?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>"More than sufficient." I felt dazed and
strange. Did he intend to marry me?
Why was he sending me to the north of
England? But it was delightful, I could
not describe my feelings.</p>

<p>"Now you must have some food," he said,
getting up and moving to the door as he
spoke. "Come with me to the dining-room."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>A SOUND WHICH REMINDS ME OF
MY PAST</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> table was laid for luncheon in the
dining-room, and as I took my seat at a
place he pointed out, he went to a speaking
tube and whistled down it. Then I
heard him ordering the carriage to be ready
in an hour. "Will that suit you?" he asked,
looking at me.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. I was laughing now.
Oh, life had turned so in a moment from
awfulness to loveliness. I never pinched
myself to feel if I were in a dream or not.
I have read about that in stories, and I
think it's stupid, besides, I did not want to
wake up if it was a dream. I did not want
to talk either, I was too happy.</p>

<p>I thought of the dinner I had yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
I could not remember what it was, then I
remembered I had not dined yesterday at
all; I had lent my last shilling to Jessie,
who lives in the room below mine; she had
sworn to pay me back in the evening if she
was lucky, and then she came back drunk
at twelve o'clock, swearing like a soldier,
poor Jessie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Wilder ate very little and spoke scarcely
at all, I think the only thing he said in the
way of conversation was "I never have
servants in the room when I am eating;"
and I said to myself, "Thank goodness."
Just imagine how I would have felt if one
of those dreadful men-servants had been
gliding about the room,&mdash;my wristbands
all frayed, my hands not very clean, for
those cheap gloves dye one's hands, and
my collar crumpled.</p>

<p>Wilder wanted to open me some champagne,
but I said no. I thought he looked
pleased. He had a decanter before him, and
he poured himself out a glass from it.</p>

<p>"I don't ask you to take this," he said
in an apologetic sort of manner; "because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
it would&mdash;well a glass of it would kill you,
it's opium, I am used to it&mdash;all the worry I
have had&mdash;&mdash;" His head sunk on his breast,
and I felt sorry for him, though he was so
rich and lived in such a beautiful house.
After a moment he looked up&mdash;we had
finished eating.</p>

<p>"Gerald," he said, "I want you to be
happy; poor soul, you have suffered too,
but perhaps it is for the best."</p>

<p>"Why do you call me Gerald?" I asked,
staring at him. A dreamy look had come
over his strange face, perhaps it was the
opium.</p>

<p>"Did I call you Gerald?" he said, "well,
you will know why soon, I want you to be
happy."</p>

<p>He rose from the table. "Come," he
said, "I will show you to your room."</p>

<p>I followed him into the hall, then up
a great broad staircase carpeted with soft
fleecy carpet; on the first landing he opened
a door.</p>

<p>"This is your room," he said, "you will
find everything you require; when you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
ready come downstairs and you will find the
carriage waiting."</p>

<p>He shut the door on me, and I found
myself alone.</p>

<p>It was a small, but beautifully furnished
bedroom. A fire was burning in the grate;
on the bed lay a great sealskin cloak,
perfectly new. It was evidently intended
for me, I tried it on before the glass, it
reached to my feet, hiding all my shabby
clothes. Then I took it off and laid it on
the bed again. I looked at the floor beside
the fireplace. There, in a row, stood a
number of ladies' boots and shoes, different
sizes; a wardrobe stood open, I looked in,
dresses of dark silk and satin, bonnets, hats;
on the dressing-table great ivory hair brushes,
gloves, handkerchiefs, scent bottles of cut
glass, a curling tongs and spirit lamp which
was lit, a little strip of paper on which was
written, "Help yourself to whatever you
require."</p>

<p>I could have cried again, but somehow
I didn't. I looked all round, and then I
remember lifting up my arms to stretch
myself, why I did so I don't know.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Then, as I began undressing, I laughed,
I spoke to the things in the room just like
a child, I asked questions of the little silver
clock on the mantelpiece&mdash;oh, those hideous
old boots I had worn so long, they seemed
to make faces at me as I took them off.
I flung them in a corner.</p>

<p>In an alcove stood a great bath; I turned
the tap, shaped like a dragon's head, and
the water roared and foamed into the bath
through the dragon's mouth; I smelt the
water, I tasted it, it was sea water; in a
minute the bath was full.</p>

<p>The luxury of it! the warm briny water
that let one's limbs float loose like seaweed.
I pretended to drown myself for fun, then
I turned over on my face, floating, and seized
the dragon's head in both hands.</p>

<p>Then, as I lay floating, I listened to the
far away sound I knew so well&mdash;the distant
roar of carts and cabs in the streets.</p>

<p>I sprang out of the bath in a fury. I had
never thought of it before like this, now
I saw all the wretchedness that I had gone
through, saw it all a million times more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
clearly than I had ever done when I was in
it. Oh, the vile world, I could have eaten
it, eaten it.</p>

<p>Then I caught a glimpse of my naked
figure in the long glass. I was beautiful as
ever, my limbs were white as snow. I
whirled round, and my long black hair flew
out in a mist, scattering drops of water
everywhere.</p>

<p>Yes, I was even more beautiful than
before, my troubles had given my face
more expression; my teeth were perfect&mdash;Jessie's
teeth were broken&mdash;<i>Jessie</i>. I would
be revenged yet. I leaned on my side before
the great glass, gazing at myself as gloomily
as a thunder-cloud. I would be revenged
on this world. Why had God created such
a place, and the clergymen whining about
heaven, and the doctors who took a poor
girl's rings, and&mdash;I smelt a subtle perfume,
and turning, I saw a great bunch of
violets standing in a little bowl in the
corner.</p>

<p>I don't know why, but they made me
feel choky, and I remember taking them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to me and kissing them, and putting them
back.</p>

<p>Then I dried myself in a huge towel, and
dressed. I laughed at the curling tongs,
and blew the little lamp out&mdash;my hair did
not want curling tongs. I laughed to think
of the frights of women going about with
their noses in the air, who had to curl their
heads.</p>

<p>One of the bonnets in the wardrobe fitted
me perfectly. I could have chosen a hat,
but I preferred this bonnet. I put on the
sealskin cloak. Then, taking the bunch of
violets with the stalks all dripping, I put it
in my breast.</p>

<p>Wilder was standing in the hall as I
came down the great staircase. He smiled
at the violets as if he were pleased. "You
look very well," he said, passing, as he spoke,
into the library, where I followed him.
"Now, here are three letters I have written&mdash;one
to the jewellers, this one to the portmanteau
people, and this to Coutts' bank.
Drive first to Coutts', give them this letter
and my cheque on the British Linen Company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
They will open an account with
you, small as the sum is, because they know
me very well; they will give you a cheque
book, and you can give cheques to your
milliners and people&mdash;poor Beatrice, I want
you to be happy." I felt horrible for a
moment as he said this. It was said in
such a supplicatory tone, as if he wanted to
propitiate me, as if I were some evil thing
he feared, and he had said it before just in
the same voice, "Poor Beatrice, I want you
to be happy."</p>

<p>How this story is lengthening out. I
thought I could have told it all in three or
four pages, and now look, thirty pages&mdash;and
yet I want to make it as long as
possible. Can you guess what I say to the
old doctor who comes to see me every day?
I ask him, does he know how long I will
live? and he shakes his head and says
something about "the hands of Providence."
No, I answer, not the hands of Providence,
but these hands&mdash;when they have finished
writing what they have to write I shall die.
I know it.</p>

<small>INSTRUCTIONS PERFORMED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> Wilder opened the hall door and I
saw a splendid carriage and pair drawn up,
the horses champing and flinging white
foam about from their mouths. Wilder
came down the steps and helped me in, the
tall footman shut the door, and I heard
Wilder's voice saying to the coachman,
"Coutts'."</p>

<p>Gracious! all the things I thought of as
the carriage drove into Oxford Street. It
was an open landau, and I wondered that
everyone did not stop to stare at me. How
strange all the people that were walking
seemed, just like mean things that had no
business with life; how sweet the violets
smelt in my bosom.</p>

<p>How nice Wilder was, not a bit good
looking, but so different from the men I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
mostly known. He was a gentleman, one
could tell that just by his easy and languid
voice; and what a hold I had upon him.
And this journey to the north, I had a
presentiment that it was to be strange, but
how could I have told how strange, how
beautiful it was to be?</p>

<p>Then the carriage stopped at Coutts', and
the tall footman opened the door and
touched his hat as I got out. I gave
them Wilder's letter and my cheque,
and they gave me in return a cheque
book.</p>

<p>The next place we stopped at was the
Bond Street jewellers. These are the rings
I bought, see, they are on my fingers now.
I never cared for diamonds. I love colour.
My rings are mostly half hoops of sapphires,
emeralds, and rubies; they would be vulgar
only they are so glorious, and then my
hands are so beautiful that you scarcely
notice the rings: that was what Geraldine
said. Good God! these tears will choke
me: if I could only cry, but I can't, it all
comes at the back of my throat, like a dull,
heavy pain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Then we drove to the other shop in Bond
Street, where they sell travelling bags. I
chose the most expensive I could find, a
hundred and ten pounds I think it was. All
the bottles had heavy gold tops, and I
ordered my initials to be put on them. I
ordered portmanteaux as well, and the man
said everything would be ready next day
by six in the evening, initials and all.</p>

<p>It was dark when we got to Redfern's,
but that did not matter, for I had no colours
to choose; funny, wasn't it, everything I got
was either white or black or grey&mdash;mourning
or half-mourning. I don't know that it was
so funny after all, for this kind of dress
suits me. I only spent two hundred pounds
on dresses; some were to be made and sent
after me when I knew the address I was
going to, the others were to be sent next
morning to Berkeley Square. I could have
died laughing at the civility of these people
at Redfern's, they thought I was some great
lady&mdash;and so I was.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock before I got back to
Berkeley Square that evening.</p>

<small>WE SAY GOOD-BYE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the next day I spent in the house,
most of the time in the room with Wilder.
How that man depressed me. A great fire
was lit in the library, and he sat over it with
his hands on his knees and his eyes fixed on
the burning coals; the decanter of opium
was standing on the mantelpiece, a wine
glass beside it, and every now and then he
would pour himself out a thimbleful and
sip it.</p>

<p>That was a pleasant sight to have to sit
and watch, but I didn't much care. I sat
in an armchair looking at my rings and the
tips of my beautiful new shoes; it was so
delightful to have all these things again;
and sometimes I would look at Wilder's
rounded back and his shiny old coat, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
how funny it was that he had given me
all these things.</p>

<p>Sometimes I spoke to him and he always
answered, speaking in a dreamy sort of voice.
I found out that he was a spiritualist, and
all the pictures about the room were "spirit
faces,"&mdash;that is what he called them, all
except the picture with "Swedenborg"
written on it.</p>

<p>Then, after dinner, at about nine o'clock,
he said that he must take leave of me.
He took me by the hand, and the whole
time he was speaking he held it, wringing it
now and then till I could almost have cried
out with pain. This is what he said as well
as I can remember&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must take leave of you now. I want
you to start early in the morning for Yorkshire;
you will go to my country house at
Ashworth,"&mdash;a long pause, and I saw the
drops of sweat stand out on his forehead.
"'The Gables,' that is the name of my
house. You will change at Leeds and get on
a branch line; it's only an hour's journey
from Leeds."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>He spoke with difficulty, and caught at
his breath.</p>

<p>"I have telegraphed for the carriage to
meet you at the station."</p>

<p>Another pause, then speaking like a
maniac, he seized both my hands.</p>

<p>"I am putting in your grasp the only
thing I love, I am stealing a march on Fate,
boldly and desperately I commit this act,
if the end is mutual love all will be right.
I shall pray without ceasing till we meet
again, good-bye, good-bye."</p>

<p>He was devouring my hands with kisses;
then he rushed from the room. I was
almost sure now that he was mad, those
spirit faces and that opium&mdash;oh, there could
scarcely be a doubt. The thought pleased
me somehow, it made me less afraid of
something&mdash;something, I don't exactly
know what, a kind of horror had been
haunting me all day, a foreboding of
strange and terrible things to come. We
old families have these powers of second
sight, at least the north country families
have. "We old families," perhaps you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
are laughing at those words from <i>my</i> mouth;
well&mdash;laugh.</p>

<p>I went up to my bedroom, and there I
found the dressing bag and the portmanteaux
all standing open and waiting to be packed.
I felt just like a robber as I put my silks
and satins, bonnets and hats, boots and
shoes, in their proper places. Then I undressed
and sprang into bed. I was almost
tired already of my new life, my old dreams
came back to me, would I meet someone
nice to-morrow? Then I thought of Wilder
and his spirit faces, and his round back, and
his opium decanter, and I laughed till the
bed shook.</p>

<p>And yet I liked him, this Wilder, with
his strange, weary-looking face, and his
cheques and carriages and horses.</p>

<p>I fell asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>&mdash;AND I START</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> wakened next morning by a knock at
the door and a voice telling me that it was
eight o'clock. As I jumped out of bed the
very first thought that struck me was, "Shall
I meet someone to-day?" It was what I
was thinking when I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I was dressed in an hour. All my portmanteaux
were packed, they only wanted
strapping; and I said to myself, "The
butler can do that." I was not going to
spoil my hands strapping them. Then I
came down stairs to the breakfast room
where the butler was waiting, a grave looking
man of whom I had caught a glimpse
last night.</p>

<p>When I had finished he said the carriage
was in waiting, and I asked him to have my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
things brought down; he said that was done
already. And behold, when I reached the
hall door, a carriage stood there, closed, with
a basket arrangement on the top, and all
my portmanteaux piled upon it. My
travelling bag was inside. The footman shut
the door with a snap, touched his hat again,
jumped on the box, and we drove off.</p>

<p>I began to think whether I was a fool
or not to leave Wilder. I had such a hold
upon him, and now I was going I didn't
know where. His country house, "The
Gables," that sounded very fine, but for all
that, I felt nervous at going off like this,
away up to the north of England&mdash;to do
what?</p>

<p>But it was too late to turn back now,
for the carriage was entering St Pancras
station.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>NORTH!</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> footman got all my luggage together,
and bought me a first-class ticket, and whilst
he was getting me the ticket I went into
the refreshment room and bought half a
dozen packets of cigarettes and a little box
of matches; smoking soothes my nerves.</p>

<p>Then I walked to the B platform, if I
remember right, where the Leeds express
was standing, the footman following with
my dressing bag. Gracious! how civil the
guard was: he made me get into a saloon
carriage, and called me "my lady," and
told me I could have a luncheon basket
or tea if I liked, he would telegraph on to
Normanton about it. I began wondering,
was it my face or the footman that made
him so civil, perhaps it was both&mdash;heigh-ho.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>I write a fearful hand. I was never intended
for an author. I'm so lazy and so
weak just now, that it's almost too much
trouble to dip the pen in the ink pot; however,
on I must go.</p>

<p>There was a great fat man and a great
fat woman in the saloon carriage, immensely
rich, I suppose&mdash;cotton spinners or something
of that sort. How these idiots stared
at me out of the corners of their eyes; they
had heard the old guard calling me "my
lady." They would have licked my boots,
those people would. I spoke to them, asked
them did they object to smoking, and they
said "no," both together, so I lit a cigarette.
That made them certain I was a duchess.
They got out at Normanton, and the guard
brought me a luncheon basket, and a little
tea tray, teapot and all, which he said I
could take on in the carriage to Leeds; so I
had luncheon, and then I had tea, and then
I smoked cigarettes and dreamed, whilst
the train whirled away north, north, north.
Oh this north, why did I ever come
here?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>It was late in the day when we reached
Leeds, the air was chill; it was like finding
oneself in a new world. Women were
standing about the platform with their heads
covered with shawls; they had clogs on
their feet, and one could hear them go
click, clack. I gave the old guard a
sovereign. I felt sorry to part with him, he
seemed the last thing connecting me with
the south. I felt like a lost dog. I had
never felt so all that horrible time in
London: that is strange, is not it? Now,
when I was rich and bowed down to, I felt
like a lost dog.</p>

<p>I had to wait two hours for the branch
train, and as it left Leeds I looked out of
the window. It was a vile place, all
manufactories, long chimneys, furnaces,
smoke.</p>

<p>Then, after a bit, I saw the country, all
hills and twilight, dark stone walls, desolate-looking
fields, and then&mdash;a shiver ran through
me&mdash;I had seen this country before. Where?
Never in this life. It was the first time I
had ever been north.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>We stopped at little tiny stations, and
I felt tired as death when at last we drew
up at a station with "Ashworth" on the
lamps.</p>

<p>I put my head out of the window, and I
saw a tall footman standing on the platform
amongst a lot of porters, and country women
with their heads covered with shawls. I
beckoned to him, and he came at a run.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr Wilder's footman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Oh, just see to my luggage, please," I
said, getting out. I followed him to the
road beside the station where a carriage
was waiting, a closed carriage and pair, just
like the one that had driven me to the
station in London.</p>

<p>We passed four desolate-looking crossroads.
The moon, which had risen, was
lighting all the scenery round about, and I
pulled down the left-hand window to get a
glimpse of the view and a breath of the
keen, pure air.</p>

<p>On a hill opposite I saw the ruins of a
castle cut sharp against the sky. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
seen that castle before. Was I positive?
<i>Positive.</i> Look! I said to myself. Look
at that white zig-zag pathway down the
hill, look at the hill itself. Then, as I
looked, an indescribable feeling came over
me, a delightful, far-away sort of feeling.
It seemed dawn, bright, clear, and cold.
I thought I could catch the sound of a
distant horn, I thought I could feel the
claws of a falcon on my wrist. I seemed
riding on a horse, not as a woman rides,
but as a man. I felt unutterably happy.
It was the happiness of love. You understand
me, I was perfectly well awake, but
this feeling, how can I describe it, so dim,
sweet, and far-away.</p>

<p>Then the carriage stopped. It seems
that I had put my finger through the little
ivory ring of the check-string, and had
pulled it without knowing. The footman
came to the window, and touched his hat.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the name of that
castle?" I asked. "That castle on the
hill."</p>

<p>"Castle Sinclair, ma'am."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>"Oh! drive on, please." I think I said
"Drive on, please," but I cannot be sure;
at all events we drove on. I was not
terrified, I was dazed.</p>

<p>Then, through the rumbling of the carriage
wheels I thought I could again catch the
sound of the distant horn. I tried&mdash;how I
tried&mdash;to catch the feeling of early dawn,
to feel again the tiny claws of the falcon
upon my wrist.</p>

<p>What hunting morning was that, so dim
and far away? To where was I riding?
With whom was I in love? And I was
a man then, so it seemed to me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE DIMLY-PAINTED FACE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last we stopped at a lodge. I heard
someone cry "Gate," a creaking noise, and
then we bowled smoothly up a long avenue
thick-set with trees.</p>

<p>We stopped before a huge portico. Oh,
that portico set with pillars. I almost
sobbed. Was it to here that I had been
riding with the falcon on my wrist? Look
at the dull grey stone, the fluted pillars,
the great oak door. Then the oaken door
opened wide, a rush of lamplight filled the
portico, and I saw an old butler with white
hair waiting for me. As I entered the great
hall set round with armour and galleries,
the old butler bowed before me&mdash;he looked
scared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>I did not notice him. How could I
notice anything? An ordinary woman
might have shrieked aloud, but I&mdash;I
neither shrieked nor swooned.</p>

<p>I remember trying to take my gloves off,
then I gave up the attempt, and followed a
maid-servant up the broad staircase I knew
so well, along the passage I knew so well,
into a bedroom that had once been mine.
I suppose you will think I am telling lies.
Well, you can think so if you like, but people
don't tell lies just for fun when they have
a churchyard cough like mine, spitting blood
every now and then, and knowing that every
spot of blood is a seal on their death-warrant.</p>

<p>I took off my bonnet and travelling
cloak, looked at myself in the cheval glass,
and then came down stairs.</p>

<p>Supper was laid for me in the dining-room;
<i>this</i> room I did not know, not a
bit. Perhaps, after all, thought I, the
whole thing is a mistake, a fancy. If I
had been here before I ought to recognise
the dining-room of all rooms. Then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
thought struck me, and I asked the maid
servant who was waiting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has this room always formed part of
the house; I mean, has it always been used
as a dining-room?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, ma'am, it was built by Mr
Arthur."</p>

<p>"Added on to the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>That sounded queer, didn't it?</p>

<p>"How long ago was it built?"</p>

<p>"About sixty years I believe, ma'am."</p>

<p>Sixty years, oh, I was riding with that
falcon on my wrist ages before that. Do
you know that the fact of my <i>not</i> recognising
this room impressed me more than
the fact of my having recognised all the
other things?</p>

<p>After supper I was sitting at the table
thinking, when I heard someone softly
entering the room behind me. I turned
and saw the butler with white hair; he
held a book in his hand.</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, Mr Wilder asked me to
give you this."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>"Mr Wilder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, he wrote from London."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>I took the book; it was bound in red
morocco, and on the cover was written in
gold letters the word "Pictures." Pictures,
a book of pictures, just as if I were a
little girl wanting amusement! Then I
opened it and saw that it was only a
catalogue of pictures.</p>

<p>Here were the dining-room pictures.</p>

<p>"Gerard Dow, Portrait of himself.
Poussin, Nymphs bathing, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

<p>Here was the gallery.</p>

<p>"Wilder, Wilder," nothing but Wilders.</p>

<p>"Sir Geoffry Wilder, justice of appeal, in
his robes." Stay. Here was something
round which a red pencil mark had been
drawn, "Portrait of Gerald Wilder and
Beatrice Sinclair, No. 112."</p>

<p>Beatrice Sinclair&mdash;that was <i>I</i>. I felt
trembling with excitement, all the strangeness
of the last three days had got into a
focus. This picture of which the name was
drawn round with red was what Wilder had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
sent me down to see. I was going to see
my own portrait, of that I felt certain.
But stay, there was something more to be
read.</p>

<p>"Gerald Wilder slew Beatrice Sinclair
in a fit of passion. Why, it was never
discovered.     They    were engaged to be
married. He destroyed himself with the
poisoned wine which he had given to her,
drinking it from the same cup."</p>

<p>This was written in Wilder's scraggy
hand-writing.</p>

<p>"Ha!" thought I, "so Gerald Wilder slew
me in some past life; well, I don't bear
him any grudge, he must have been a
horribly wicked man though, for all that.
Now, I'll ring for the butler to show me
this picture."</p>

<p>I rang, and the old fellow came.</p>

<p>"Get a lamp, please. I wish to look at
the picture gallery."</p>

<p>"The picture gallery, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It's very dark, ma'am, at this hour.
Hadn't you better wait till morning?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>"No, I wish to go now."</p>

<p>"Very well, ma'am."</p>

<p>He shuffled out, and returned in a minute
or so with a lamp. Then I followed
him.</p>

<p>As he opened the oak door of the
picture gallery the lamp light rushed in before
us, and I saw two long walls covered
with the stern faces of the dead and gone
Wilders; dim and faint they all looked
in the faint light, just like ghosts. We
walked down the centre of the gallery.
I was looking for my face amongst all
these strangers, but I could not find it.</p>

<p>I touched the old man on the arm,
"Which is the picture of Beatrice Sinclair?"
He made no reply, but the lamp in his
hand shook with a noise like the chattering
of teeth. Then he walked to a picture
set in a black ebony frame.</p>

<p>"This is it," he said, "see."</p>

<p>I noticed that he did not say ma'am, but
I did not notice it much, I was so engaged
with the face of this Beatrice.</p>

<p>At first I felt pleased, then disappointed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
She was very pretty, but not in the <i>least</i>
like <i>me</i>. Then, as I looked, I could scarcely
believe my eyes. A dimly-painted face
began to grow out of the background&mdash;a
man's face, with long flowing hair; his
eyes were turned towards Beatrice, they
seemed also turned towards me. It was
myself. This man's portrait was <i>my</i>
portrait, the face larger and more masculine,
but the same.</p>

<p>Then the old butler dropped the lamp,
and it smashed to pieces on the floor. I
thought I could hear him weeping in the
darkness, but I am not sure. I felt I was in
the room with a ghost, and I remember
catching the old man's arm, and his leading
me towards the light glimmering in from
the hall.</p>

<small>GERALDINE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">"Well,</span> suppose I was once a man, suppose
I was Gerald Wilder," I said to myself as I
went into the library and music room, where
a fire was lit, "Oh, bosh&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I shut the library door and looked round.
Thousands of books, a grand piano standing
open, cigar boxes, cigarette boxes, easy
chairs, turkey carpet. I lit a cigarette, and
turned to the piano. I play well, but I
am always too weak to play now. Here
was Schuman, Chopin, everything in a
classical way.</p>

<p>I like Chopin.</p>

<p>As I played I sometimes stopped to
think and knock the ashes from my cigarette.
The wind had risen and was blowing in gusts&mdash;oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that wind of autumn, how melancholy
it sounds.</p>

<p>As I was playing I caught the sounds
of horses' feet, then the crash of wheels upon
gravel. It stopped, a carriage had drawn
up at the hall door, "Could it be Wilder?"</p>

<p>I listened. Someone was let in. I heard
the sound of voices, then everything was still.
I rose from the piano and went to the
door. I opened the door softly about an
inch, and peeped through the crack. I
saw a girl, but, as her back was towards
me, I could not see her face. She was unwinding
herself from a huge cloak of furs.
The sallow-faced housemaid was standing
waiting&mdash;I suppose for the cloak. Then
I closed the door as softly as I had
opened it, and sat down in one of the
armchairs by the fire. I felt excited, why,
I could not tell.</p>

<p>I was staring into the fire point blank,
just as an owl stares at the sun, but I did
not see the fire, I could only see the long
slit-like picture, the strip of shining oak
floor, the figure of the girl with her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
thrown back, and her body, with its snake-like
movement, winding free of the cloak.</p>

<p>Who was she? this girl. She had come
in that carriage. She had been let in out of
the autumn night. I had seen her taking off
her cloak. I knew nothing more about her,
so why&mdash;why did my heart become all of a
sudden so fussy and fluttering like a bird
disturbed in its nest, why&mdash;ah, it seemed to
me that with her had been let in the far-off
sound of that ghostly horn, with her had
been let in the unseen falcon whose claws
were now again resting upon my wrist&mdash;moving,
moving, as the body they supported
balanced itself uneasily, tightening now as
the balance was nearly lost, loosening now
as it was regained.</p>

<p>I sat listening. Not a sound. These
great oak doors were so thick that a
person might walk about in the hall and
not be heard in the library. The clock
on the mantel gave the little hiccup it
always makes at five minutes to the hour;
I looked up at the dial, it pointed to five
minutes to nine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Then a knock came to the door. I started
and turned round. It was only the old
butler. I felt just as if a bucket of lukewarm
water had been emptied on me,&mdash;deep
disappointment, why I felt so I can't
tell. He wanted to know if I required
anything more to eat&mdash;supper.</p>

<p>No, I required nothing to eat.</p>

<p>He stood shuffling at the door as if he
wanted to say something, his dismal old
face looked more troubled than ever. I
thought for a moment he was going to
cry. Then suddenly he shut the door and
came across the room. He stood before
me, twiddling a book that lay on a little
table. He looked at the carpet, then at the
fire, then at me, then he spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been in the service of the family
forty and nine years, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Have you?" I answered, I didn't know
what else to say.</p>

<p>"Forty and nine years come next October.
Oh, ma'am, I've seen strange things in
those years, and&mdash;the world's a strange
place."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"It is."</p>

<p>"Ma'am, Miss Geraldine knows you are
here, and she will come in to see you presently."</p>

<p>"Miss Geraldine&mdash;was&mdash;was that the
young lady&mdash;I mean, was it she who arrived
in the carriage just now?"</p>

<p>"It was, ma'am, and that's why I want to
tell you. Mr James told me to tell you; it's
only beknownst to Mr James and I&mdash;God
help me&mdash;God help us all&mdash;Miss Geraldine&mdash;is
a boy."</p>

<p>"A boy," I said, half rising out of my
chair; "what do you say&mdash;how&mdash;how can a
girl be a boy?"</p>

<p>"Hush, ma'am, for the love of God don't
speak above your breath. People may be
listening, and no one knows it, <i>not even
Miss Geraldine herself</i>."</p>

<p>I was sitting now with my mouth
hanging open like a trap; I must have
looked the picture of a fool.</p>

<p>"Not even herself, God bless her sweet
face, not even herself, and that's not the
worst, ma'am,&mdash;she <i>is</i> a girl, though she's
been born a boy."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>The old fellow had suddenly collapsed
into the easy chair opposite to me; he had
taken his face between his scraggy old
hands, his head was bent between his knees,
the light of the lamp fell on the shiny black
back of his coat. I shall never forget him
as he sat there, speaking between his legs as
if to someone under the chair.</p>

<p>"She's Beatrice Sinclair, that's who she is,
and they must be blind who don't see it.
Beatrice Sinclair, Beatrice Sinclair, she, the
one that was killed long and ages ago by
Sir Gerald. Beatrice Sinclair, whose picture
is in the gallery, and that's who she is, that's
who she is."</p>

<p>He was rocking about and droning this
out like a dirge. I can tell you I felt shivering
and fascinated. Then all at once he sat
up and seemed to remember himself. I saw
tears on his poor old face. He seemed trying
to rise out of the arm chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, don't get up," I said. "Tell
me, for I must know, tell me exactly what
you know, tell me all about it, and how it
is that Miss Geraldine is&mdash;what she is."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>"It was done to avoid the evil chance,
ma'am."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You must know, ma'am, that the two
houses of Sinclair and Wilder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I know what you are going
to say; you mean that the Sinclairs have
always killed the eldest sons of the Wilders,&mdash;it's
a kind of fate. Mr James Wilder told
me all about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, mam, that's it. Well, when this child
was born Mrs Wilder only survived the birth
some two hours, and Mr James, almost mad
with grief at her death, seemed like a thing
gone silly; then, after some weeks, he quieted
down, and all the love he had for his wife
seemed to settle on this his only child. It
was a boy, and that, mam, was the trouble;
if it had been a girl! but no, it was a boy,
and the eldest and only boy, and doomed,
that was Mr James' word, I've heard him
speaking it to himself as he has stood
looking out of the window at the park, the
one word, 'doomed&mdash;doomed.' He took
me into his confidence, he said to me once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
'The Sinclairs ride through my dreams,
their ghosts are round me, but they shall
not have my child.' He would have gone
mad, I do believe he would, only that he
thought of a plan. He took me into his
confidence, and between us we did it. The
child's name was changed from Gerald to
Geraldine, and the child was brought up
as a girl. No one in the house knew; all
the servants were dismissed but me, 'We
are safe now,' said Mr James. Ma'am,
do you know that from the lodge
gates this park is surrounded by a stone
wall, sixteen miles long and six feet high?
it cost a mine of money, but it was built.
Do you know that Miss Geraldine has
never been beyond that wall? There are
sixty and more miles of drives all through
the park, and there the horses that draw
her carriage can go at a gallop and go all
day without crossing the same ground twice
over. There are lakes, and fountains, and
imitation rivers, and that's the world she's
only known. It cost two hundred thousand
pounds a-doing, but it was done. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
ma'am, things went like a marriage bell till
Miss Geraldine was past fourteen; then one
day Mr James came out of the picture gallery
with his face like a ghost, and he caught
me by the arm so that I thought I'd have
screeched with the pain of it, and he says,
'James, James, the Sinclairs have got us.'
Those were his very words, and with that he
led me into the gallery, right to the ebony
frame with Mr Gerald's picture and the
picture of Beatrice Sinclair, and there, sure
enough, was the likeness. Miss Geraldine
had grown the living image of Miss Beatrice
Sinclair; we hadn't noticed the likeness
before, but it was there, sure and sorrowful.</p>

<p>"After that Mr James fell away, like.
He took to the opium, and took to it awful.
He followed Miss Geraldine like a dog. He
had it in his head that <i>he</i> was doomed to
kill her, till, it was three years ago now,
ma'am, Mr James, who had taken to spiritualism,
got a message saying that the last of
the Sinclairs was alive and doomed to kill
the last of the Wilders, that the only chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was to bring them together and leave them
to fate.</p>

<p>"Then Mr James began to search for this&mdash;this
last of the Sinclairs. He searched
the world, that he did; his agents went to all
foreign parts, to India and everywhere, till a
few days ago, and I got telegram after telegram
from him to prepare the house, that
he had found the person he wanted. Oh, I
was glad, that I was, when I saw you, ma'am,
I nearly fell on the ground."</p>

<p>"You think I am like Mr Gerald?"</p>

<p>The old fellow made no answer for a
moment, then he got up off his chair to go.</p>

<p>"Ma'am, you'll excuse my sitting in your
presence, you'll excuse my talking so free,
but I am old, and I have grown to love that
child as if it was my own, it's that sweet
and that innocent, and, saving your presence,
ma'am, doesn't know what a man is, or a
woman is neither. I've heard talk of angels,
but there never was an angel more innocent,
no, nor more sweet; and to think of
harm coming to it, it that is so unharmful.
It wrings my heart, the thought of it do;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
many's the night, ma'am, I've woke in a
sweat thinking I've heard the trumpeter,
but it's been only ringing in my ears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The trumpeter, what do you mean?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"The ghost, ma'am, Sir&mdash;Sir Gerald's
ghost, it comes through the passages at midnight
blowing a trumpet always before the
eldest son is killed. Oh, ma'am, it's a fearful
sound and a fearful sight."</p>

<p>"When was it heard last?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-three years ago, ma'am, the night
before Mr Reginald was killed by Mr Wilfred
Sinclair."</p>

<p>Twenty-three years, that was exactly my
age.</p>

<p>"It has not been heard since, not even
at Mrs Wilder's death?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, that trumpet never sounds
for the death of women, not for no one,
only the eldest son who is about to die."</p>

<p>"Did anyone hear or see this trumpeter
the last time he came?"</p>

<p>"I did, ma'am, see him, and hear him
both."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>"Tell me about it. Did you see his
face?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am." Somehow I knew the old
fellow was telling a lie, and that he <i>had</i>
seen the trumpeter's face, but I said nothing.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, not distinctly so to say. I
was a young servant then, an under-butler,
and in the night, when I was sound asleep,
I suddenly woke and sat up to listen. The
house was as still as death, and there was
nothing to hear, yet I sat listening and
listening and straining my ears, waiting to
hear something that I knew would come.
Oh, ma'am, I needn't have strained my ears,
for suddenly the most <i>awful</i> blast of a
trumpet shook the house, I sickened, and
thought I'd have died, for though I knew
nothing of the ghost, or the history of the
house, I knew that the sound of that trumpet
was not right; it stopped for a moment after
the first blast, and then it came again, louder
and louder. I rushed out of my room into
the dark passage, then, ma'am, I ran down
the passage and down the servants' staircase
until I found the first floor. I ran down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the corridor till I came to the great staircase
overlooking the hall, and there I saw him.
There was no light, but I saw him, for there
was light all round him. He was crossing
the great hall when I caught a glimpse of
him. His long black hair was tossed back,
and he had to his mouth a great, glittering,
silvern trumpet, and I could see his cheeks
puffed out as he blew. He was dressed like
the portrait of Sir Gerald."</p>

<p>"You think it was Sir Gerald's ghost?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, he has been recognised over
and over again."</p>

<p>"Did anyone else hear him?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, only me. I told the master
about it next day. No one had heard it
but me. Then the message came to say
Mr Reginald was dead."</p>

<p>I sat silent for a moment, listening to the
wind as it sighed outside, then I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you expect to hear the trumpeter
again?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, not since you've come."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>The old fellow hung his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"Come now," I said; "tell me this.
Don't you think you see the ghost in the
flesh? I am exactly twenty-three, and it
is twenty-three years since the trumpeter
has been. Do you not think that my
coming is the return of the trumpeter&mdash;without
the trumpet?"</p>

<p>I shall never forget the old man's face as
I said this; it absolutely became glorified
with&mdash;what&mdash;I don't know, perhaps hope.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am," said he, "I did see the
trumpeter's face, despite the lie I told you;
it was your face, line for line. But you
will never hurt the child, that I know, for
the good God has sent you into the flesh,
and it's as much as if He had said the
trumpet shall never be heard again, which
is saying the eldest son will never be killed
again by the Sinclairs."</p>

<p>Then the old fellow left the room and
shut the door.</p>

<p>And I sat brooding over the fire, half-pleased,
half-frightened, half-dazed. The
old butler's manner all through his conversation
had been just like James Wilder's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in London. They both seemed to consider
me as something to be feared and propitiated.</p>

<p>And this Geraldine, this extraordinary
being whose fate seemed wound up in
mine, why should they fear any hurt to
this Geraldine from me? I could not hurt
a fly, much less this creature whom I had
begun to like instinctively already.</p>

<p>Did anyone ever hear of such a thing as
to bring up a boy as a girl? Only that weird
looking James Wilder, with his round back
and his opium decanter, could have thought
of such a thing; she&mdash;he&mdash;she, what shall
I call him or her? She was going to pay
me a visit to-night; when would she come?
What was she doing now? at supper perhaps,
what was she having for supper?</p>

<p>A tap at the door.</p>

<p>The handle turned, and the door opened.</p>

<small>WE MEET</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> this was Geraldine Wilder, or Gerald&mdash;Geraldine
Wilder, if you please.</p>

<p>This half ghostly being, with brown rippling
hair and a face like the face of a wild rose.
And the dress of wonderful black lace that
seemed draped round the slight figure by
the fingers of the wind, and the milk white
neck, rising like the stem of some graceful
flower to support the small brown head, and
the <i>elegance</i> of the whole apparition. I love
to think of it even still. But it was Beatrice
Sinclair. Oh, yes, beyond any manner of
doubt, it was Beatrice Sinclair, and as we
gazed at each other for one short second
the claws of the falcon <i>tore</i> at my
wrist.</p>

<p>Then this vision of the past came across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the room and held up its face to be
kissed. And it was like two dead lovers
kissing through a veil&mdash;so it seemed to me.
And yet I could have laughed as she sat
down in the great arm chair opposite mine,
to see the subtle turn of the body with
which she arranged the train of her dress,
the graceful manner of sitting down, and
then to remember that "Miss Geraldine was
a boy;" and then the glimpse of immaculate
white petticoat! it seemed like a witticism
one could not laugh at because one was in
church.</p>

<p>I laugh now as I think of it, at least I
smile, for I haven't strength to get up a
real laugh, and then somehow I cry, perhaps
because I am so weak.</p>

<p>Geraldine sat down, and then we began
to talk. I talked at random, for I was
so busy examining and admiring her I
couldn't think of other things. The little
division at the end of the nose seemed somehow
the most delightful thing I had ever
seen, except maybe the arched instep of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
tiny foot that peeped like a brown mouse
from beneath the skirt.</p>

<p>What a lout I felt beside her. I felt
awkward, and stupid, and just as a mole
might feel if it were made to sit in the sun.
I began to stutter and stammer, and might
have made a dreadful fool of myself, only
that the recollection shot up in my mind,
"she's a boy"; as long as I kept that in
mind I was all right, but the instant I
began to think of her as a girl, my stupidity
returned.</p>

<p>We talked, mercy, what modest and innocent
talk, the whole college of Cardinals and
the old Pope himself might have listened
and been the better for it, but they would
not have been much the wiser.</p>

<p>"Gerald&mdash;I mean Geraldine&mdash;how old
are you?"</p>

<p>"I am sixteen years."</p>

<p>"You have never been away from home,
you have never seen a city?"</p>

<p>"What is a city?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a place, a horrible place where
it's all smoke, and houses, and noise."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>Geraldine shook her head. She could not
imagine what such a place as this could be
like.</p>

<p>"Are there many more people in the
world from where you come?" asked Geraldine
after a pause, resting her chin on her hand
and gazing at me with a deep, far-away
look, as if she recognised me dimly but was
not quite sure.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but has your father never told
you about the world and the people in it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Geraldine, with a shake of the
head; "he told me it was a bad place, and
I must never go there, that was all."</p>

<p>"Have you never wished to go there?"</p>

<p>"No, never, till&mdash;till now."</p>

<p>"Why now?"</p>

<p>"I would like to go there if it is the place
you come from."</p>

<p>Geraldine was gazing at me now intensely&mdash;I
know no other word&mdash;with eyes that
seemed appealing to me to say something;
never had I been gazed at so before.</p>

<p>I could only falter out, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Geraldine, "I think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
know where you come from, I think I have
seen you there, but it was in a dream, and
we were not dressed as we are, but I am
not sure. <i>Who</i> are you?"</p>

<p>I have never heard anything so soft and
yet so full of a kind of fire as those words.</p>

<p>"Has not your father told you, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he said a lady was coming to see
me, but that was all."</p>

<p>"I am Beatrice Sinclair, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"But that is only a name."</p>

<p>A thought shot like a horrible zig-zag
firework through my brain; it was, "Geraldine,
I was once your murderer."</p>

<p>Then bang from tragedy to comedy. I
began to laugh, for no earthly reason, and
Geraldine caught the laugh as it flew on her
beautiful lips, and we both laughed at each
other like two children&mdash;at nothing. Then
we talked for an hour about&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>As Geraldine vanished that night to her
own rooms I called her back, and she came
back from the dark corridor like a beautiful
ghost.</p>

<p>I only wanted to kiss her again, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
seemed to think that a perfectly good reason
for my calling her back.</p>

<p>Then I went to bed and cried like a fool;
then I got out of bed and hunted round the
room in the dark, guess what for&mdash;a match-box,
guess what to find&mdash;my cigarette box.
I really think I must once have been a man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I found</span> it, and having lit the candle by
my bedside I got back into bed and began
to smoke. The fumes of the tobacco, the
utter silence of the house broken only by the
occasional sighing of the wind in the trees
outside, the exquisite room in which I was
lying with its painted ceiling and rose
petal coloured hangings, the image of
Geraldine, all combined to produce in my
mind a sort of delicious intoxication.</p>

<p>I saw now vaguely the wonderful dream
that was beginning to unfold around me,
the fairy tale of which I was to be the hero.
I saw once more the face that had come
back from the dark corridor to be kissed&mdash;ah
me!</p>

<p>My hands rested upon a little black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
covered book, I had found it upon the
mantelpiece, and had taken it into bed
with me, thinking to put my cigarette
ashes upon it. Instead of that I had
shaken them off, without thinking, upon
the floor.</p>

<p>I opened it. The first thing I saw was
the picture of a skull drawn in faded ink
upon the yellow title-page. Then, under
the skull, written in what, even in those
old days, must have been a boy's scrawl,
this&mdash;</p>

<p>"The blacke worke of deathe herein sette
downe is bye y<sup>e</sup> hande of Geoffry Lely
hys page."</p>

<p>Whose page? I knew well.</p>

<p>Then, on the next leaf, in the same
handwriting, but smaller and more cramped,
I read the following. It was written in the
old English style, and the queer spelling
of the words I cannot imitate, as I write
only from remembrance.</p>

<p>"Before daylight of that dark and bloody
day a week agone now, by lantern light
we left the court-yard and rode down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
avenue, Sir Gerald on his black horse
Badminton, I on the bay mare Pimpernel.
In the black dark of the avenue
nothing could I see, but followed, led by
the sound of Badminton's hoofs, the
clink of Sir Gerald's scabbard, and
the tinkling bells of the little hawke
that sat hooded and drowsing upon his
wrist.</p>

<p>"Had I followed a common man I might
have asked of him what place hath a
hawke on the wrist of a man with a sword
by his side and pistols at his holster, but
Sir Gerald I have followed my life
long without question, and without
question would have ridden behind him
to death.</p>

<p>"In the road beyond the darkness of the
trees we paused, each at five paces from
the other; the clouds in the easternmost
part of the sky were all cracked where the
day was breaking through; a dour and dark
morning was it, and no sound to hear
but a plover crying weep, weep, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
little tinkle ever and anon of the hawke's
bells.</p>

<p>"I watched the wind toss Sir Gerald's
black hair and lift the plume of his hat,
and let it fall, and lift it again, and let
it fall, light as if 'twere the fingers of a
woman at play with it. He was resting
in his saddle as if a-thinking, then
touching Badminton with the spur, he
led the way from the road on to the
moor, the two horses' hoofs striking as
one.</p>

<p>"We passed the shoulder of the hill and
down to the Gimmer side, and there by
the river we stopped again and Sir Gerald
sat and seemed a-listening to the mutter
of the water and the wuther of the wind
in the reeds; but he was in sore trouble,
that I knew by the way his head was
bent and by the sighs that broke from
him ever and anon.</p>

<p>"And where his trouble lay I knew, for
I had but to look the way his head was
turned, and see Castle Sinclair, all towers
and turrets, set up against the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
which was breaking quickly out from under
the clouds.</p>

<p>"As we sat I heard a horn sounding
beyond the river bank and the yelp of a
hound blown on the wind thin and sharp,
and in the distance, crossing the ford of the
Gimmer, I saw three horsemen; they were
Sinclairs, that I knew,&mdash;General James Sinclair
rode first, I could tell him by the great
size of himself and his horse, and of the
other two I knew one to be Rupert and the
other George, but which was which no eye
of mortal could tell in the dim light that
was then.</p>

<p>"They passed the ford and rode away,
a huntsman following close on, seeming to
move in the midst of a waving furze
bush, which was the hounds in full pack,
and the last of them we heard was the
toot of the horn sounding over the hillside.</p>

<p>"Then Sir Gerald touched Badminton
again with spur, and we rode along the
river bank to the ford, still warm from the
crossing of the Sinclairs; and the ford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
behind us, we set our horses' heads straight
for Castle Sinclair.</p>

<p>"The morning was up now, and we could
hear the cocks a-crowing from the
barnes lying to the thither side of the
castle. In the courtyard we drew bridle, and
Sir Gerald dismounted and threw his reins
to me.</p>

<p>"At the open door above the stone steps
stood Mistress Beatrice Sinclair herself; she
held in her hand a silver stirrup cup. Without
doubt she had lingered at the door
from seeing the huntsmen off to their
hunt, held mayhap by the fineness of the
morning.</p>

<p>"I saw Sir Gerald advance to her, his
plumed hat in hand, and they passed into
the great hall so that I could not see them
more, and there I sat to wait with no sound
to save me from the stillness but the cawing
of the rooks in the elm tops below, and
the grinding of Badminton's teeth as they
chawed on the bit.</p>

<p>"The clock in the turret struck six, and I
sat a-thinking of Mistress Beatrice Sinclair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
holding her beautiful face up to the eye of
my mind, and putting beside it for contrast
the dark face of Sir Gerald. Then the
clock struck seven and Badminton he struck
with his hind hoof on the yard pavement
and neighed as if calling after his
master.</p>

<p>"Then five minutes might have gone.
I saw Sir Gerald's figure at the door, his
face white as the ashes of wood, and he
stumbling like a man far gone in drunkness.
But drunkness it was none and that
I knew, but some calamity dire and fell, and
I put Badminton up to the steps in a trice,
for I read the look in Sir Gerald's black eye
which meant 'flight.'</p>

<p>"As he rose into the saddle a window shot
open above, and a woman's voice cried,
'Stop them, stop them, my lady is dead,
he has killed her!' Then, reeling in my
saddle with the horror of the thing, I put the
bridle rein to Sir Gerald's hands. He heard
and saw nothing, that I knew by his eyes
and his face, so, leaving Pimpernel to care
for herself, I sprang on Badminton behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Sir Gerald, and taking the reins with my
hands stretched out, I put spurs deep into
his sides.</p>

<p>"The wind rushed in my ears and the
cries of the woman grew faint; down hill we
tore, I heard the splashing of the Gimmer
water round Badminton's legs and the hoofs
of him rattling on the pebbles of the ford.
Then I heard behind me the clashing of
the alarum bell of the castle.</p>

<p>"Something in Sir Gerald's right hand,
hanging loose, took my eye, and I sickened
at the sight, for it was the body of the little
brown hawk crushed to death.</p>

<p>"I looked back, Castle Sinclair stood out
against the blood red of the sky. Up
suddenly against us rose a great man on a
black horse. It was General James Sinclair
spurring for the castle; he threw his horse on
his haunches. Badminton he reared, and Sir
Gerald fell forward before me on his neck,
his dark hair all mixed with the mane. Then
I drew rein, I called to Sir Gerald, but no
answer made he; his lips were blue, dead he
was as the little hawk crushed in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
dead as Mistress Beatrice Sinclair, poisoned
with the selfsame poison he always carried
in his ring; dead as I Geoffry Lely shall be,
and that soon, from the sorrow that has
fallen on me since that dark and bloody
day."</p>

<p>There the writing stopped. I only quote
from memory, but it is a good memory, for
that strange bit of writing burnt itself deeply
into my heart. It occupied six pages. The
seventh was covered by Wilder's handwriting.
It was the beginning of a horrible list, the
list of the eldest sons of the Wilders.
Each name stood there bracketed with
the name of a Sinclair. I knew what that
meant. This was the way:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Beatrice Sinclair&mdash;Gerald Wilder.</i><br />
<i>John Wilder&mdash;Rupert Sinclair.</i><br />
<i>Adam Wilder&mdash;James Sinclair-Sinclair.</i><br />
<i>Athelstan Wilder&mdash;Arthur Reginald Sinclair</i>,<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>That list horrified me, I could not go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with it. At the foot of all these names so
strangely coupled together James Wilder
had written a sort of prayer.</p>

<p>"Oh, God! how long! how much longer
shall this blood red hand be held over us?
I have but one little child, I implore your
mercy for it. Have pity upon me and it,
<i>we</i> have done no wrong."</p>

<p>That made my eyes swim so that I could
scarcely see. I shut the little black book;
it looked like a witch, and I determined to
burn it. The fire was still red in the grate,
so I got up and put it on the live coals.
It burned quite cheerfully. I watched it
as I lay in bed, and I muttered to myself,
"Let the past die like that." I watched
the cover all curling up, and little jets of
blue flame spouting from the leather
binding. Oh, if it were only as easy to
burn the past as it is to burn a book!
Then nothing was left but sullen-looking
grey ashes, with little red points running
over them.</p>

<p>Then I blew out my candle, and the
room was in darkness. The wind sighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
outside in the tree tops. I saw all kinds
of pictures painted on the darkness, faces,
and one angelic face, the last before I went
to sleep&mdash;Geraldine's.</p>

<small>THE MORNING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> ago I had been living in &mdash;&mdash;
Crescent, living in a room with an old faded
carpet on the floor, with one picture on the
walls,&mdash;and such a picture, I can see it still,
it was a German oleograph representing the
Day of Judgment, and so badly done that the
long trumpets seemed sticking in the sides
of the angels' cheeks, not out of their mouths,
and some of the devils, I remember, had their
tails growing from the middle of their backs.
The looking-glass made one look horrible,
and the handles were off the chest of drawers,
so one had to pull the drawers out with
a crooked hairpin.</p>

<p>I minded the picture more than anything.
Some girls would have grumbled at the chest
of drawers, and never thought of the picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
but I have always loved beautiful things, so
I suppose that is the reason why I grumbled
so much at the picture and so little at the
other thing.</p>

<p>You may think, then, how delightful it
was next morning when I woke and saw
the light filtering in through the rose-coloured
blinds. I sat up in the bed and
saw the glimmer of the great ivory hair
brushes on the dressing-table. I saw my
rings lying in a heap&mdash;I would never have
had those rings only for Geraldine, I would
never have been here, only for Geraldine, I
might have been in the Thames, floating
with dead cats and dogs by this, only for
Geraldine. Then I fell back on the pillows,
smothered with a strange kind of horror; it
was strange, because it had no reason for
being. It passed away slowly like a mist
dissolving, and I lay looking up at the blue
ceiling, with rosy clouds painted on it, and
little Cupids peeping at each other from
behind them. I pulled up the blinds of
my window to look out; then I opened
the sash.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>It was an autumn morning, warm and
dark, the wind of the night before had blown
half dead leaves about the garden on which
my window looked; it had rained in the
night, and the air was full of the smell of
dampness and decay, and a faint perfume
like the bitter perfume of chrysanthemums;
there was just enough wind to make the
trees move their leaves about, and make a
noise as if they were sighing. I love this
autumn weather; I don't know why, perhaps
it's just because I don't know why that I
love it. That seems rubbish, but I am too
lazy to scratch it out. It is just like autumn
now as I sit writing this, though it is early
spring, and the trees are all covered with
little green buds, making ready for another
autumn that I shall never see.</p>

<p>Then I dressed. I put on three dresses,
one after another, and they all seemed not
good enough; but I had no more fit for
morning wear, so I left on the third.</p>

<p>Then I came down to breakfast, and I
found only one place laid. I could have
broken my plate over the old butler's head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
but I didn't, and I can't for the life of me
tell why I could have done it, or why I
didn't do it. Breakfast proceeded in solemn
silence.</p>

<p>"Would I have ham?"</p>

<p>No, I would not have ham! where was
Geraldine?</p>

<p>Miss Geraldine breakfasted an hour ago
alone in her wing of the house; Miss
Geraldine sent her compliments, and wanted
to know if I would visit her in her own
rooms after I had finished breakfast.</p>

<p>He might take Miss Geraldine my compliments,
and say that I would have much
pleasure in doing so. He had better go
at once. No, I required no more coffee.</p>

<p>He went.</p>

<p>Her compliments, indeed, and her wing of
the house, I wonder why she didn't send her
card. Yes, I would visit her just as often
as I pleased&mdash;yet I would not if my visits
didn't please. No, in that case I would
drown myself in the moat, but there was no
moat; well, in the big bath upstairs. And
the way the old butler said, "Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Geraldine" quite calmly, though he knows
Miss Geraldine is a boy; and she is a
boy, and she ought to be smacked for
being such a prig. But why smack her
when it's not her fault? No, it's James
Wilder and the old butler that require
smacking, and still&mdash;and still, these two
old fools between them have produced, or
helped to produce, this weird child, just as
she is; and in all God's earth she is the
most beautiful thing, and the most strange.
She is like a thing made of mist, yet she
is real; she is a ghost, yet one can touch
her. What is she&mdash;what is he&mdash;who am
I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I don't want to know.
Ha! I felt just then the claws of the little
falcon pinching my wrist.</p>

<p>That was the jumbling kind of stuff that
ran through my head as I breakfasted; then,
when I had finished, instead of going at
once to find Geraldine's wing of the house,
I hung about the room looking at the
pictures, putting off my visit just as a
person puts off a bite at a peach. At last
I came.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>I seemed to know the way by instinct;
there was no placard with "To Geraldine"
on it, but I found Geraldine for all that.
I crossed the hall and passed the picture
gallery scarcely looking at the door. Then
I lifted a heavy corded silk curtain, and
found myself in a corridor. Upon my word,
I thought I was in the Arabian Nights.
Each side of the corridor was panelled, and
on the cream white panels were painted
flowers,&mdash;it was a regular flower-garden of
painting. The roof was white, with coloured
windows, each made in the shape of a fan.
These stained glass fans were the prettiest
things in the way of windows I had ever
seen&mdash;so I thought. The corridor ended
in a heavy curtain like the one at the
other end; two doors stood on each side
of the curtain. I chose the right hand
door, for I guessed it belonged to the
room she was in. I was right. I
knocked. A voice cried, "Come in," and
in I came.</p>

<p>Oh, this Geraldine! I must have seen
her all askew last night, for now she seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
eight times lovelier than she was then.
Who had taught this being the art of
putting on dress? Surely not James
Wilder or the old butler. This dress she
wore was made from a fabric intended to
represent the skin of some tropical lizard,
scales of golden satin on a body-ground of
dull emerald-coloured silk. She rose from
her chair like a snake from a blanket.
James Wilder, when he rose from a chair,
always reminded me of a flail in a fit.
Yet she was his son.</p>

<p>We said "Good morning," but we did
not kiss. Something seemed to have come
between us; we seemed instinctively to hold
aloof from each other. The Geraldine who
came up to me last night to be kissed, just
as a tame fawn might have done, was not
exactly the Geraldine of this morning. And
yet I liked this something that had come
between us. Kisses are just like apples;
if you can get as many as you want they
grow tasteless, and the more you pay for
them the sweeter they seem, and they are
never so sweet as when you steal them. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
never heard of a farmer robbing his own
orchard, have you?</p>

<p>Then this fine lady sank back into the
chair from which she had arisen&mdash;it was
not sitting down, it was sinking down&mdash;and
with a ghostly smile resumed her work.
And guess the work&mdash;tapestry. Tapestry;
and she had done yards of it, when she
ought to have been playing at marbles and
learning to swear.</p>

<p>As for me, I sat down plump on a chair
close by, crossed my legs, and nursed my
knee with my hands. I felt inclined to
whistle. Remember, I was thinking of her
now as a boy in petticoats, and as long as
I thought of her as that I was in my right
senses, that is, my everyday senses. I felt
perverse, just as I always feel, and would
have liked to tease&mdash;only I wouldn't have
dared&mdash;this half-absurd, wholly delightful
production of old James Wilder. But
when I thought of her as a girl I felt&mdash;I
felt the dim remembrance of a past life,
and an infinite sadness.</p>

<p>I looked round at the room; it looked like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the inside of a shell. Fairies seemed to
have furnished it. I never saw such exquisite
things before. There were cabinets
inlaid with copper on ebony, and Venice
glass that seemed coloured with tints of the
sea. A wood fire was burning on the tiled
hearth, and a great bowl of violets stood
on a table supported by carved dragons
with jewels for eyes. The smell of the
violets made me feel faint every now and
then, but the faintness went away when I
remembered this Geraldine was a boy.
"Remember that," I kept repeating to
myself. And in the middle of the room
sat Geraldine.</p>

<p>The long French windows were open,
and the garden, all damp and sad-coloured,
lay outside. Great chrysanthemums, potted
out, were nodding under the marble-coloured
sky, and they all seemed nodding at
Geraldine. When a hitch came in the
thread Geraldine's under lip would pout out.
I felt now and then as if I were acting
in a play, and the chrysanthemums' faces
were the faces of the audience. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
they were. Anyhow, I had learnt my part
very badly, so it seemed to me.</p>

<p>The tapestry was a great blessing; one
could speak or not as one pleased, and I
generally preferred&mdash;not. I fell to wondering
does <i>she</i> remember anything of that
hunting morning so long ago: does she
remember the poison, has she forgiven the
poisoner, and has God?</p>

<p>Then I began to talk to her again and
she answered in a low measured voice that
sounded to me like a bell from the far past,
yet in spite of the ghostly kind of sadness
with which her voice filled me, some of her
answers made me laugh.</p>

<p>She didn't know how to read; that came
out in the course of our scrappy conversation.</p>

<p>"But, <i>Geraldine</i>, why&mdash;you've never read
your <i>Bible</i>, then?"</p>

<p>One might have thought from my tone
that I was a shocked Sunday-school superintendent,
and it really did seem shocking to
me that a person should never have read
the Bible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>"What is my Bible?" asked Geraldine,
staring at me, half-frightened at my astonishment.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a book. I'll tell you about it
some other time, but&mdash;but you can't know
Geography. Do you know where Japan is,
Geraldine, or India?"</p>

<p>Geraldine's head shook. She looked dazed.</p>

<p>"Do you know where England is?"</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she knew where England was,&mdash;this
house, this garden, all away beyond
there, was England&mdash;all over there.</p>

<p>How proudly she waved the white hand.
It was patriotism pure and simple. She was
proud of her park, not because it was her
park, but because it was her native land.
Her&mdash;his&mdash;I cannot say "his," I must
always say "her;" besides, it doesn't matter
now. It will never matter again, nothing
will ever matter again. What gibberish I
am writing; how those trees nod and nod
their heads as if they were nodding at the
little graveyard "away over there," just as
the chrysanthemums were nodding that
morning at Geraldine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>She didn't know her Bible and she didn't
know her Geography, and she didn't know
"nothing." What a lot of ignorance was
stowed away in that small head; but she
knew something of natural history. The
tapestry work had stopped, and we were
walking in the little garden where the
chrysanthemums were. I pointed to a snail
on the path.</p>

<p>"What is that, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"That," said Geraldine, "is a snail."</p>

<p>How proud she seemed of her knowledge,
and how tenderly she lifted the snail on to
a leaf. The clock in the clock-turret was
striking noon.</p>

<p>"Can you read the clock, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and my watch."</p>

<p>A watch the size of my thumb-nail was
produced. How learned she was, really a
kind of professor!</p>

<p>We walked down an alley of cypress
trees without speaking, then we stopped, for
the sound of a gong came roaring from the
house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>It was the luncheon gong, so said
Geraldine, and I suddenly woke up from a
reverie to remember that I was not in the
seventeenth but the nineteenth century.</p>

<small>"YOU WERE NOT DRESSED LIKE THIS"</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old clergyman who lives at Ashworth
has just been. He comes twice a week and
eats a biscuit and drinks a glass of wine,
and tells me we should all think on the
future life, or the life to come. He asked
me what I was writing, and I said&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;that day I had luncheon all alone.
Where that other strange being had luncheon,
or whether she had luncheon at all, I don't
know; I had luncheon alone, and I had
chops for luncheon.</p>

<p>What did James Wilder mean by sending
me here to be driven mad? What was driving
me mad? Why, Geraldine was. I had
sprung at one bound into the most fabulous
world of love. I could have eaten that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
snail she lifted on to the leaf, just because
she touched it.</p>

<p>The old butler was meandering round
the room with a dish of vegetables in his
hand.</p>

<p>"James," I said.</p>

<p>"Ma'am."</p>

<p>"I have fallen in love with your Miss
Geraldine."</p>

<p>"May God be thanked, ma'am."</p>

<p>"James," in a coaxing voice, "I want to
go out for a drive with him&mdash;I mean with
her&mdash;with Miss Geraldine. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, and so shall I tell the
horses to be put in?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, after luncheon, that is, if
Miss Geraldine likes; do you think she
would like?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am," in a voice like the voice of a
ghost, "Miss Geraldine has been a-speaking
of you to me; she comes to me, ma'am,
to tell any little trouble that may happen
like as she was a boy, which she is, may
God in Heaven bless her; and she came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
me last night after you'd a-gone to bed, and
she said, 'James, who is Beatrice Sinclair?'
Lord, ma'am, you might ha knocked me
down with your finger. 'Why,' I says,
Miss Geraldine, 'she's the lady just come.'
Then she says 'James,' and she held down
her head and all her little face grew red,
'Will she ever go away again?' 'Why,
Miss Geraldine?' said I. 'Because if she
does,' said she, 'I shall die; I've been waiting
for her and thinking of her for years,
and if she leaves me now I shall die:'
those were her words."</p>

<p>A bucket of vitriol emptied into a furnace
those words were to me.</p>

<p>"The horses," I cried, rising from the
table, "ring for the horses; go and tell
Miss Geraldine to dress, for I am going to
take her for a drive. Go." I stamped
my foot, I was speaking like a man. I
was suddenly intoxicated. I felt hat, boots
and belt upon me; the falcon was on my
wrist. I clapped my hand on my left
hip and was astonished to find&mdash;no sword.
That, somehow, brought me to, and I sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
down at the table again feeling shrunk&mdash;shrunk?
do you understand that word?&mdash;shrunk
like an apple that has been all
winter in the cellar&mdash;shrunk like a warrior
who wakes to find himself a woman. "She
hung down her head and all her little face
grew red," how exactly those words brought
her image before me. This little milksop.
I was sitting at the table; the old butler
had gone to order the carriage; the light
of the autumn day came greyly through
the great double windows, a spray of
withered wistaria was tapping at one of
the panes like the hand of a ghost. Before
me, on the opposite wall, hung a convex
Venetian mirror, one of those strange
mirrors that are made so perfectly and so
truly that they reflect everything just as
it is, even the atmosphere, so that a room
reflected by them seems like a real room.
I was staring at my own reflection in
the mirror, and wondering over again at
my own likeness to the portrait of Gerald
Wilder&mdash;when&mdash;the door in the mirror
opened, a figure the size of my thumb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
entered the mirror room, a figure lithe
and more gorgeously clad than any caterpillar.
I knew quite well that it was only
Geraldine who had opened the door behind
me, and was therefore reflected in the
mirror. I knew that quite well, yet I
watched the mirror without moving: the
little figure seemed to hold me in a
spell. It came up softly behind the woman
seated at the table&mdash;the woman with the
face so like Gerald Wilder; it paused as
if undecided. I watched.</p>

<p>Geraldine evidently was utterly ignorant
of the mirror and its picture. Geraldine
the observed imagined herself unobserved:
then, like a little thief, she bent her lips
to kiss the woman's hair without the
woman knowing. I threw my head back
and caught the kiss upon my lips, I threw
my arms back and caught her round the
neck; never was a thief so caught in his
own trap.</p>

<p>Then I turned round, and let her go,
and confronted her, all at the same time.
And there she stood, "with her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
hung down and all her little face grown
red."</p>

<p>Love has never been described properly:
all that about roses and altars is nonsense.
Love is like being in a beautiful and
mysterious room, and you push a curtain
aside and you find a more mysterious and
more beautiful room, and you see another
curtain. How that comparison would
shock the people who write poetry. Imagine
comparing love to a suite of rooms.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that drive; the horses
were those Russian horses that go as if
they were mad; the air was all filled with
the smell of autumn, and the earth seemed
as silent as the leaden-coloured sky. The
park lay all dull-coloured and damp, the
great trees were standing with their leaves
hanging down.</p>

<p>Miles and miles of park we passed through;
there were sober and sad-coloured hills in
the distance that seemed to watch us with
a mournful air. The country had for me
the aspect of fate as it lay around us, silent
as a dream, the trees dropped their withered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
leaves, the clouds passed by, the wind blew,
and clouds and wind and trees all said to
me in their own language, the past, the past,
the past. Once Geraldine said, "When I
saw you before, so long ago, you were not
dressed as you are now."</p>

<p>No, Geraldine, I said to myself, when you
saw me before, so long ago, I was dressed as
a man. But I did not answer her in
words.</p>

<small>THE BALLADE OF THE FALCON</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the deep window of the library, where I
am sitting now wrapped in shawls and
scribbling this, I came that day after our
drive to sit and think, and stare out of the
double windows at the dusky garden, and
wait for tea. I had taken an old book from
one of the library shelves. It was "The
whole art of Falconry," dedicated to his
Majesty, King Charles the First, by his liege
servant&mdash;I forget whom.</p>

<p>When I was tired with looking out of the
window I turned over the leaves of the
book; they smelt of age. Between the cover
and the last leaf was a manuscript, the ink
faded, the paper mildewed. I spelt it out in
the dusk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>It was a ballad written in a curious, old-fashioned
hand. It was about a little falcon
which a lady had given to her lover; he
killed her in a fit of passion, and he killed
the little falcon, or "the little hawke," as the
ballad sometimes called it, and then he
killed himself. As I read it grew sadder
and sadder, it seemed to moan to me like a
living thing, and my eyes became blind with
tears so that I could scarcely read it in the
twilight. It was all about the little falcon,
but I knew that the pity was meant for
the cavalier. Perhaps the writer dared not
express it openly, for was not the cavalier
an assassin and a suicide?</p>

<p>This is the last verse, as well as I
remember&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">For the hawke's blinde little eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">&mdash;And the cavalier who lies</div>

</div></div>

<p>Ah! the dead hand that wrote that long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
ago betrayed itself in the two last lines,</p>

would break. I was crying, not for the
cavalier but for "the little hawke."</p>

<small>MY LETTER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night I went up to my room early.
I took pens, ink, and paper with me&mdash;why
I took them I had no notion&mdash;I took them.
I lit all the wax lights on the mantel, and
the wax lights that stood on the dressing-table.
Then I stood before the dressing-table
mirror looking at myself. I can see
the reflection of my face still, a pale face
with dark sombre eyes, and lips that curled
in a sneer. That was how Gerald Wilder
looked when he was in a rage. I could
see now Gerald Wilder, the assassin and
the suicide. I was Gerald Wilder.</p>

<p>Geraldine and I were inextricably entangled&mdash;she
in the body of a boy, I in the
body of a woman. Was this my punishment
for that murder and that suicide committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
long, long ago, this blind maze of the flesh
into which I had been led? I could do one
of two things. Leave Geraldine to-morrow
morning, never to see her again, or&mdash;stay.
If I left her she would break her heart,
and die. I would break my heart, and die.
Then perhaps we might meet, and be happy
for ever. Surely, if all those stars were suns,
and if there were worlds round them like
our world, God might give us some little
place, some tiny garden out of all His
splendour. He was rich, and owned the
whole of space, and He would give something
to two ghosts who had left the world
for the love of each other. That was what
would happen if we left each other&mdash;we
would grow sick and die, but we would
meet on the other side. If we remained
together, I knew that something would
happen to separate us for ever, how I
knew this I cannot tell, perhaps it was by
instinct.</p>

<p>I turned from the mirror to the table,
where I had placed the writing things.
Now I knew why I had brought them up:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
it seems to me that we often think when
we don't know we are thinking.</p>

<p>I sat down, and took one of the thick
sheets of paper stamped in red with</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">The Gables,<br />
"Ashworth, Yorks</span>,"</p>

<p>and I wrote. This is what I wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear James</span>,&mdash;I know now why you
have sent me down here. I have seen
your Geraldine, and I love her, but I must
leave her. It will kill us both, but I have
chosen to die. <i>Can</i> you not see that I am
your kith and kin, that I am Gerald Wilder?
You have no claim on Geraldine, for she is
a Sinclair, she is the dead Beatrice returned
as a Wilder. I think I see it all now, if
one may see anything in such awful darkness.
I know, without knowing exactly
<i>how</i> I know it, that if we part we shall
dream of each other till we die, and that
then we shall meet never to be separated,
but if we remain together some fearful
thing will happen and divide us, so that
we may never meet again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>If I loved your son all would be right,
but it is not Gerald I love, but Geraldine&mdash;Beatrice.</p>

<p>I am leaving here early to-morrow
morning, going, I don't know where. I
shall write to you.</p>

<p class="blockquotright"><span class="indentright">Signed,</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Gerald Wilder</span>."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I directed an envelope&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
JAMES WILDER, <span class="smcap">Esq.,<br />
No. &mdash; Berkeley Square,<br />
London</span>.</p>

<p>I put the letter in. I gummed it. Then
I began to search for a stamp. I felt that
I must stamp it to add a kind of security
to my purpose, though the post did not
leave until noon on the morrow. What a
search I had for that stamp. I rummaged
all my dress pockets; at last I found my
purse,&mdash;there were two stamps in it.</p>

<p>I stamped the letter carefully. I held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
it in my hands as I sat over the fire.
Then, without any apparent reason, I tore
the letter slowly up into four pieces, then
into eight. Then I placed the pieces
carefully on the burning coals in the grate.
I watched the stamp burning and thought
it was a pity to see it burn, for it was
worth a penny. I saw the d e r letters of
Wilder stand out white on a bit of the
burnt envelope.</p>

<p>Then I took the poker and poked at
the bits of paper ash.</p>

<p>I was thinking.</p>

<p>All my life long I have loved everything
beautiful: colours have a strange fascination
for me, you could make me sad quicker
with a colour than a story or a poem;
scents and sounds have the same effect,
the smell of violets suddenly transports me
to somewhere, I don't know where, I only
know it is elsewhere. I have heard things
in music that no one has ever heard, notes
that come up again and again as the harmony
moves to the end of its story, sombre notes
full of fate. I have seen people listening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
music and their faces had no more expression
than jugs; I have heard women talking
of the opera, utterly unconscious of the
story the music they were listening to was
telling them.</p>

<p>I was sitting by the fire thinking; the
bits of burnt paper had flown up the
chimney in a hurry, perhaps the devil had
called them. I was thinking in pictures,
and I felt unutterably happy and relieved
now that I had written my letter to James
Wilder&mdash;and burnt it.</p>

<p>I saw my room in &mdash;&mdash; Crescent. The
creature that had inhabited that room was
not <i>I</i>. I saw the room so distinctly that
I saw on a shelf an old tattered book&mdash;Dumas'
"Three Musketeers." I used to
read it sometimes at nights, and I used to
wonder how it was possible that the Duke
of Buckingham could have loved Anne of
Austria in the insane manner in which he
did; now I saw at a glance that such love
was quite possible, and no fable. He loved
her because she was unattainable, she was
a Queen; he could never have loved an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
ordinary woman like that. A soap bubble
is the most beautiful thing in the world
because it is so unattainable, you cannot
put it in your pocket.</p>

<p>Then Geraldine suddenly appeared before
my mind. Not only Geraldine, but the
thousand and one things that made her
up. I have told you before that colour
and scent and sound seem to act as food
and drink to me. This Geraldine had all
these in their fullest perfection, like some
strange tropical fruit that no one could
imagine till they had seen. At no point
was she imperfect; she was an utter little
dunce, but that was her last and crowning
fascination: she could not spell A B
ab, and the problem of what twice thirteen
was would have filled her small brown head
with distraction. She could not tell you
where Asia was, nor whether Japan was
the capital of China; but neither could
one of those delightful things we read of
in the old stories, things that come out of
a fountain and turn into a shower of spray
when spoken to.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>I was going to stay, then. What on earth
made me dream of leaving <i>Geraldine</i>? Did
that idea really occur to me? To leave
here and get into a <i>railway train</i> and go
back to a place called London&mdash;to turn
back out of the seventeenth century into
the horrible nineteenth century, with its
railroads and smoke, and telegraphs, just
because a hideous old woman called
Reason had told me to do so or it would
be wrong.</p>

<p>I took another sheet of paper and wrote.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear James</span>,&mdash;I know now the reason
why you sent me here. I have fallen
in love with your mysterious Gerald.
Leave us together and have no fear,
lovers never hurt each other, except,
perhaps, with kisses. I shall write to
you every other day.&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquotright"><span class="indentright">
Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Beatrice Sinclair</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter I gummed up in an envelope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
I had no trouble to find a stamp for it; my
purse lay on the table and in it the other
stamp. Then I put the letter on the mantel,
and went to bed.</p>

<small>THE BLACK HORSE AND THE WHITE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> such a strange dream. I dreamt
that I was in man's clothes, and that I
was astride of a coal black horse: how
I knew that the horse was black I
scarcely can tell, for the night around me
was dark as death, Geraldine was on the
pommel before me, grasping me round the
loins with her arms; her head was on my
breast, the horse was galloping mad, mad
he seemed; behind me galloped a man on a
white horse, a man in the dress of a cavalier.
I turned my head now and then to look at
him. He was myself, and he was dead.
He swayed and he reeled in the saddle.
His spurs were plunged and stuck in the
white horse's sides, and great flakes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
bloody foam fell from them through the
darkness like red flowers; we tore through
archways that seemed to roar at us, down
white roads, and through tiny hamlets with
lights that winked at us, and then we were
in the darkness again, on a moor. A
ghastly moon broke through the clouds
overhead. I looked back, he was still following,
swaying and reeling, now falling flat
back on the back of his horse, so that his
long black hair mixed with the horse's tail,
now falling straight forward, his hair all
thrown and mixing with the horse's mane.
I saw the nostrils of the white horse
blown out thin as paper, its staring, straining
eyes. Then the darkness fell again and I
found Geraldine gone; and the moon broke
through again, and I saw that the white horse
had overtaken me and passed me, and was
far ahead, and the cavalier, reeling and
swaying in the saddle, held Geraldine in his
arms, and they were both dead. Then my
horse faltered and stumbled and fell. And
I woke. All around me was in black darkness.
I felt the pillows to make sure I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
in bed, then I felt for a match-box on the
little table by the bed-side, and I struck a
light. The clock on the mantelpiece pointed
to quarter past five. I rose and lit a candle,
and put on a wrapper. I felt frightened. I
wanted to go to Geraldine to see if she were
all right. You never love a person so much
as just when you wake from a dream of them,
at least I quote from my own experience.
I opened my bedroom door, the passage
was utterly dark, and the house seemed
strangely still. I came along the passage
like a ghost&mdash;only I had a candle in my
hand, and you never hear of ghosts carrying
candles. I reached the top of the great hall
stairs, and I saw the hall below, with the men
in armour standing round the oak-panelled
walls and the grey dawn glimmering down
at them through the stained glass windows.
I came down the stairs, crossed the hall. My
feet were bare, but I did not feel the cold of
the parquet. I pushed the curtain aside
that led to the corridor with its flower-pictured
walls and fan-shaped windows.
The heavy curtain at the end concealed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
bedroom, that I knew. I blew out the
candle and raised the curtain. A door half
open; I pushed it and entered. On a bed,
white as snow, lay a little figure curled up
under the sheets. The window-blinds
had not been drawn and the grey, still light
fell on a small face. Never seemed anything
so fast asleep as this form. As I stood
watching it, it seemed to me that I could
still hear the galloping of the dream horses,
I felt like a thief. Geraldine was safe
then; she knew nothing of that furious
ride through the night, heard none of the
galloping of those horses.</p>

<p>As I turned from taking a last look at
the sleeping face I felt awed, not exactly
awed, but frightened. Do you know that
perfect and absolute purity frightens one
to look at, as if it were a ghost? You
may laugh, but it does, though it is more
rarely seen than any ghost. I have only
seen it once, and that was when I saw
this child asleep with the dawn on her
face.</p>

<p>When I had found my room again I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
drew up the window-blind and opened the
window. The trees in the garden stood
all dripping with dew in the grey light
that came from the slate-coloured sky, and
the chrysanthemums looked like the ghosts
of chrysanthemums. Not a breath of wind.
I looked up at the sky. Two crows were
flying lazily in the distance, their black
wings winking dreamily as they flew. Not
a sound.</p>

<small>THE OLD OAK CHEST</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I woke</span> at nine o'clock. Someone had
knocked at my door. It was only the maid-servant
with hot water.</p>

<p>I had gone to sleep at six o'clock with
the vision of that strange grey dawn in my
head, and now at nine&mdash;I can never account
for my motives, I seem built up of perversities&mdash;at
nine o'clock I woke, and my
first sensation was one of irritation. I was
irritated with myself, and I was irritated
with the thoughts of the old butler. I was
irritated with the window-blind which I had
drawn down all crooked. I was in a sulk
with Geraldine.</p>

<p>I looked at my face in the looking-glass.
I was a fright. My eyes were red. I
dressed, and I actually did not care what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
dress I put on. It did not matter; all
my dresses were hideous, every woman's
dress was hideous, except Geraldine's, she
alone knew how to dress.</p>

<p>Really never before had I been in such
a vile and senseless humour. It seemed
to take in the whole world. I passed in
review all the men I had ever known.
They were all about equally detestable;
they seemed all so like one another, more
or less hair on their faces, that was all, and
yet women fall in love with these creatures;
but then, what were women? I passed in
review all the women I had ever known,
and all the women I had ever heard of&mdash;they
all had to stand for inspection beside
the strange figure of Geraldine. Oh, what
fools they looked, what dummies, what
empty-headed apes, tricked out in borrowed
feathers, full of spiteful tricks, and tricks
to draw the attention of those other apes,
the ones with beards.</p>

<p>I thought of the school-girls at the
boarding-school,&mdash;those virgins so full of
suppressed vice, their finnikin manners, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
whispers, and their sniggers. I never
thought that I too had been one of those
vicious virgins.</p>

<p>I pricked myself with a pin, and that
brought me back from my thoughts. Then
I went down to breakfast. One place as
usual. Old James the butler seemed grown
ten years younger since that night so long
ago when he let me in first, that night so
long ago, the night before last. He darted
about so quick that he upset a plate of
muffins on the floor. Then bang! my bad
humour changed suddenly to good.</p>

<p>What did this little wretch mean by
breakfasting alone at unearthly hours? Did
she have strange people out of the garden
to breakfast with her? people with feet like
roots, and faces like flowers. I had seen
this Geraldine looking at the chrysanthemums
with an expression of face as if she
knew more about them than a mortal ought
to know. Last night a great moth flew in
from the garden, and rested quite familiarly
on her hair, just above her ear. She treated
the snails just as if they were kinsfolk. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
felt sure that to her breakfast-table guests
came who would have flown, or run, or
crawled, from <i>my</i> presence.</p>

<p>Then, like a sombre note of music, came
the recollection of my dream. I heard the
mad galloping of the horses, and my good
humour turned to sadness. You must think
me a very changeable person, but that is just
what I am. I am jotting down all my feelings
as they came, so you can see that it
takes very little to move me from sorrow
to laughter.</p>

<p>I have written seventy-three pages!
almost a little book. To think that I should
ever have written a book, no matter how
small!</p>

<p>Well, when breakfast was over I sat for
awhile making up my mind that Geraldine
might come to me before I came to her;
then I got up and did exactly what I had
determined not to do. I came down the
toy-house corridor. I knocked at the right
hand door; no answer. I pushed the door
open and peeped in; no one. I knocked at
the bedroom door; no answer, but I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
not go in, I felt somehow afraid. Then I
turned to the left hand door. I opened it.
It was a strangely pretty room, but it did
not contain Geraldine. It looked like an
oratory; the roof was arched, and at the
far end the daylight through a stained
glass window shone glimmering down on
the polished oak floor. A silver lamp swung
from the ceiling, and an oak table, plain
and rather severe looking, stood in the
centre. This was where she probably
dined, if she ever dined, and breakfasted all
alone.</p>

<p>What a life this strange being must have
led, just like a nun, and many a morning
she must have sat here all alone whilst <i>I</i>
was&mdash;where?</p>

<p>Do you know that all the sermons ever
preached would have had less effect upon
me than the sight of this room? I suddenly
saw the beastliness of the world we all live
in, just as plainly as if it had been some
vile reptile crawling from under that oak
table; but we never see sights like that for
long, just half a second or so, and then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
forget. I looked for a moment, then I
turned away. Where had she gone to?
was she hiding? could she be in the
garden?</p>

<p>No, she was not in the garden; the
chrysanthemums all looked as if they knew
but would not tell. Oh, those chrysanthemums,
how they haunt my dreams,
actually haunt me; they are all dead and
forgotten, but their faces seem to haunt me.
Geraldine made them human when she
walked amongst them, she touched their
faces as if they were faces of brothers and
sisters. I saw her smile at one once, and
once I saw her actually frown at one of
them, and now they come and haunt me
as if to say, "What have you done to
Geraldine?"</p>

<p>Then I began to feel uneasy. Where could
this strange child be? had any accident
befallen her? I remembered my dream, and
hurried back to the house. Old James, the
butler, was crossing the hall, a tray of glasses
in his hands. I asked him had he seen the
child, did he know where she was hiding?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>He answered that she had gone out for
a drive; she went at eight.</p>

<p>I could have boxed the old fellow's
ears.</p>

<p>Was she in the habit of going out for
drives so early in the day?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, several times a week the horses
were ordered early. That exasperated me.
So it was a habit not to be broken
through on my account. Just because it
was her habit, she had gone out and left
me all alone, knowing very well that I
would be hunting for her. Then I remembered
the absurd fright I had been in
about my dream, and I remembered the
strange and passionate parting of the night
before, and now this cold creature had gone
out for a drive; no wonder she was so fond
of snails.</p>

<p>Where was the use of loving a creature
like this? it would build a house for itself
of your dreams and sighs and groans, and
then crawl off with its house on its back.
All my waking irritation returned. I
told the old butler to bring me my luncheon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to my room when luncheon-time came, for I
felt ill&mdash;so I did&mdash;and would not come
down again that day.</p>

<p>Then I went upstairs to my bedroom
utterly determined to give Geraldine a
lesson that she would never forget. She
might wait for me, but I would not come,
not I.</p>

<p>Up in my bedroom I fell into one of
those stupid fits in which we&mdash;at least I do&mdash;take
a tremendous amount of interest in
nothing. I looked at my rings and at my
hair brushes. I looked at myself in the glass.
I stood with my head against the pane, looking
out at the garden. The weather had not
altered, still moist and warm and autumny;
all these three days seemed carven out of
the same kind of weather so that they might
last for ever as one piece, all the same,
beautiful, sorrowful, and dark. "For ever" I
say, for I am sure I shall see them even
when I am dead: perhaps they will be for
me the only solatium through eternity, given
me to look at, like some gloomy but beautiful
jewel to a sick and sorry child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>After a while I grew tired of taking an
interest in nothing. I fell to wondering
what Geraldine would do or say if I
killed myself or was killed. She would
go out for a drive very likely. Then
I thought what a fool I had been to
prison myself up in my bedroom and
give out to the old butler that I was ill.
I smoked a cigarette as I thought, and then
I determined on an expedition: I would go
for a prowl.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor on which my
bedroom opened there was a door. Yesterday
morning I had opened this door to see what
was behind, and had seen a staircase, a spiral
staircase, that had somehow an elfish look.
I told you before, I think, that on my
first arrival at this house everything except
the dining-room seemed familiar. Well, that
feeling had utterly vanished, yet <i>still</i> everything
remained familiar. I don't exactly
know how to explain my meaning fully,
unless I can make you understand that
the ghostly part of the familiar feeling
was gone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>Well, the little staircase cropped up in
my mind just as I finished my cigarette,
and I determined on exploring it. I looked
out of my room to see that no one was
about, then I came along the corridor, softly.
I opened the door, and there was the
little spiral staircase all covered with dust.
I shut the door behind me, and I can tell
you it required some courage to shut that
door and remain alone in the dark with
that ugly little staircase. Then up the
staircase I went, feeling my way by the
cold little bannister rail, till suddenly my
head came bump against something. I
put my hand up and felt a trap door. I
pushed it, and it fell back. What a strange
room I entered, perfectly square, and lit
by one dusty window. The walls were
hung with arras, and the only piece of
furniture was a large black oak chest, carved
all over with foliage and figures. It stood
opposite the window.</p>

<p>Somehow this room had a strangely
forlorn and melancholy appearance, it had
also a vague and musty smell. The arras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
looked ghostly. Perhaps it was the perfect
silence, but it appeared to me that here
a horse and there a stag seemed ready to
jump from the canvas.</p>

<p>I sat down on the oak chest, and began
to observe the tapestry more attentively.
Beginning at the window, my eye ran along
it. Here was a hunting scene&mdash;a meet evidently&mdash;ever
so many horsemen surrounding
a man on a white horse, he seemed the chief;
he was dressed as a cavalier, his hair was black
and flowing. Beyond, in the distance, lay
a castle, a castle on a green hill, with a white
pathway running down it. I knew that
castle was meant to represent Castle Sinclair.
A little further on another scene. The
same cavalier, riding, and by his side a
lady on a brown horse; how proudly the
horses stepped. A little further on another
scene, love this time, and the same
man and the same woman; they were
kissing.</p>

<p>Then I knew by a kind of intuition that
this tapestry was meant to represent the
connection of the houses of Wilder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Sinclair, worked, probably, through long
generations by the pious hands of Wilder
women.</p>

<p>Suddenly I got up and looked at the
tapestry just behind me. Yes, the same
man and the same woman&mdash;she on a couch,
he on the floor, perhaps dead, a broken
glass beside him. Was that the poison
running on the tapestry-wrought floor?&mdash;perhaps.
The next scene was a funeral
procession; black nodding plumes and
bowed heads.</p>

<p>I looked no more; that tapestry gave
me the shivers.</p>

<p>I turned to the oak chest and raised the
lid; an odour of rosemary filled the air.
I peeped in. Down at the bottom lay some
clothes, carefully folded, on the clothes a
sword, and on the sword a great cavalier's
hat with a magnificent black feather; I
took out the hat and sword, and laid them
on the floor, then I took out a most exquisite
amber satin doublet, and the other parts of
a man's dress. Down at the bottom still
there lay a pair of long buff-coloured boots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
with silver spurs, and a great glittering
silver trumpet, to which was attached a
long crimson silk cord.</p>

<p>I would have clapped my hands, only
my arms were so full; here was everything
I wanted. That little Puritan with the pale
face would whimper no more for jingling
spurs and a sword on her lover. Oh! the
good sword! I drew it from its sheath,
and looked at its broad, strong blade, all
damascened near the hilt, then I popped
it back in its sheath, and kicked off my
shoe. I wanted to see if the boots would
fit; I tried one on, it fitted to perfection.
This cavalier, whoever he was, must have
had an amazingly small foot. Perhaps he
was Gerald Wilder. Nothing more likely,
for this room seemed dedicated to him,
and these things were possibly his
relics; any way, they were mine for the
present, and I promised myself a fine
masquerade.</p>

<p><i>What</i> would Geraldine say when she
saw me?</p>

<p>I took out the trumpet; it looked like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
battle-trumpet; there was a dint upon it
as if from a blow. It was solid silver, and
was marked near the mouthpiece with a
little tiger and a P surmounted by a tiny star.
It was evidently intended to be slung
round the back by the silken cord, so I
slung it round my back, and taking all the
other things, I left the room, laden like an
old clothes man. I had fearful work shutting
the trap door with all the things in my
arms, but I managed it at last, and got
safely back to my bedroom without having
been seen.</p>

<p>On the dressing-table stood a silver tray
with some luncheon and a decanter of
sherry; so the old butler had been. I
shut the door and locked it, then I placed
all my booty on the bed, and sat down
to eat what the old fellow had brought
me.</p>

<p>As I ate I thought how fortunate it was
that there were so few servants. The only
ones I had seen indoors were the butler and
the sour-faced maid. There must have been
a cook, and a very good one, hidden down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
stairs somewhere, but she, or he, was never
visible. How, thought I, do these two
manage to keep this great house in
order? they are always working like galley
slaves, I suppose, and Wilder pays them
like princes; anyhow I am very glad,
two are quite enough, almost two too
many.</p>

<p>Then I rose and placed the luncheon
things on the floor out of my way, and then
I took all the hairpins out of my hair and let
it fall as it always wants to fall, right round
my shoulders in black, curling locks. Then
I undressed. I laughed as I put on the man's
things, but my heart was fluttering fearfully
lest they shouldn't fit. I shall never forget the
perfume of rosemary from the amber satin
doublet as I drew it on. Then the boots,
how the spurs jingled; but I would not look
at myself in the glass yet, I was not perfect,
for the sword still lay on the bed, and the
trumpet. I buckled the sword-belt and
swung the trumpet behind me, then with
one hand on the hilt of my sword and one
hand on my hip I whirled round on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
heel to face my image in the cheval
glass. I can never tell you, nor could you
ever imagine, the deep, the <i>furious</i> pride that
filled me as I gazed at the glorious-looking
man who faced me in the mirror. Can
you imagine an eagle condemned into being
a sparrow; can you imagine the feelings
of that eagle should it find itself once more
an eagle royal and splendid? So great, so
overmastering was this feeling, that I utterly
forgot Geraldine and the whole world that
held her.</p>

<p>I was myself again, yet I was completely
changed. All my waywardness and woman's
pettinesses seemed vanished and drowned.
As I looked at the cavalier with black
flowing hair, I smiled, and he smiled. How
gloomy and stern was that smile. What a
graceful, and strange, and poetic-looking
man he was; one could imagine him
riding through a battle with his face unmoved,
one could imagine him terrible
in love.</p>

<p>And he was <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>Then I turned and threw myself into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
arm-chair. Geraldine had just entered my
mind, and the stern cavalier, who would have
laughed in the face of a battle, became like
a child. Do men turn weak like this before the
image of their love? I veritably believe they
do.</p>

<p>"Geraldine," I thought, "she went out;
ah, yes, this morning. I shall go to her when
it is dusk. Will she smile, or will she frown,
and my white rose will she wear it?" Then
I found myself wondering what rose. I
could not remember actually that I had
given her a rose, yet a vague impression
filled my mind that I had. Somewhere long
ago I had given her a rose, and my fate
seemed to depend on whether she would
wear this rose, now, this evening.</p>

<p>Oh, I tell you, on that afternoon, ay, and
ever since I put on the dress of the cavalier, I
was not and am not&mdash;what I was. That
dress seemed to seal a compact, and I was,
and am still, partly drunk with the remembrance
of a dim and shadowy past.</p>

<p>I sat in the arm-chair thinking; time must
have flown as it never flew before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>I would go to her with the dusk and
behold it was dusk!</p>

<p>And the wind had risen with the dusk
and was sighing amidst the garden trees like
a ghost.</p>

<small>THE TRUMPETER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I rose</span> from the arm-chair, and I stood, I
remember, sucking in my underlip and staring
at the floor. Then I turned to the
wardrobe, and took out my great sealskin
cloak. I threw it round me and it reached
to my feet. I wished to conceal my
clothes, why, I did not exactly know, but
it seemed to me that they ought to be
hidden from everyone but Geraldine.</p>

<p>Then I opened the bedroom door softly
and peeped into the passage. No one&mdash;not
a sound. I stole down the corridor
to the head of the great staircase, and
peeped over into the hall, the lamps were
not yet lit. Then I came down the staircase
so softly that you might have thought
me a shadow only for the faint, silvery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
jingle of the spurs. I entered the corridor,
and the heavy silk curtain fell behind
me. Then I found myself standing at the
right hand door with my hand pressed to
my heart. No actor about to enter before
his audience could have felt the nervousness
I felt. My heart seemed gone mad.
Then I dropped my sealskin cloak and
my nervousness fell with it. I tossed my
hair back, felt the hilt of my sword, and
without knocking, I turned the door handle
and entered.</p>

<p>The figure of a girl stood at the open
window; she was gazing out at the dusk-stricken
garden. Then she turned and saw
me. I heard her breath caught back, and
I saw in her hand a white rose.</p>

<p>Did I cross the room? I must have
crossed it, but I have no recollection of
doing so. I knew nothing of the world
or the things in the world, save a face
that was trying to hide itself on my
shoulder, and a voice that was whispering
"You have come." Yes, one other thing
I knew. A beetle passed by out somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in the garden, and the dreamy and
mournful boom of his wings mixed sadly
with my intoxication, seeming like a voice
from long ages ago.</p>

<p>Oh, that meeting in the grey autumn
dusk, that voice repeating over and over
again the words "You have come." When
shall I hear those words again? Never.
There is no perhaps for me, I know in some
strange way that I shall hear those words
again&mdash;never. And the fault is mine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE TRUMPETER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fault is mine, for I knew, and Geraldine
knew nothing.</p>

<p>I knew the past. I knew of my sin. I
knew, by some instinct, that God had
brought the past to me. As a means of
redeeming my crime He had imposed renunciation
upon me as a penance, and I had
chosen instead of renunciation this deathly
masquerade. I would not be debased, I
would not be humbled. God help me&mdash;I
am humble enough now. All that is what
I see now; just then I saw nothing and
cared for nothing but Geraldine.</p>

<p>We kissed only once, just like two
frightened children, then we both passed
into the garden. Geraldine's arm I had
drawn round my waist. We wandered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
locked together, through the dusk of the
garden. We found the dark yew tree
walk by instinct; there was a seat and
we sat down. We could scarcely see each
other, we were utterly dumb, confounded
with love.</p>

<p>We heard the wind pass by: we heard
the dew fall, and the crying of the night-bird&mdash;a
hooting sound.</p>

<p>The rest of that evening I only remember
in silhouettes, just as a drunkard remembers
his drunkenness. I remember the parting.
I remember it well, for I saw it reflected in
a long mirror. Across the room where we
had been sitting, I can see the picture
still&mdash;a cavalier standing by a girl.</p>

<p>Then I found myself in my bedroom
all alone, the clock on the mantel striking
twelve. The window-sash was open: the
clouds had all broken up, and the moon
was shining on the trees. I leaned on
the sill, my head supported on my
right hand, my left hand on the hilt of my
sword. I listened. The wind was sighing
amongst the trees, and on the wind I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
something far away and strange. A confused
noise, it seemed like the noise of
a battle in the distance. I tossed back my
hair, and my left hand worked at the hilt
of my sword. Yes, it must be a battle,
a great battle in the distance. I caught
the cry, "Sinclair, Sinclair," and then a
cry like the distant sound of a thousand
voices, "For the King." I heard the far-off
tramp of horses, the vague cries, the
clash of steel. Then the imperious call
of a trumpet, the call of a battle-trumpet.
I sprung to my feet from my stooping
attitude. I swung the trumpet from behind
me, and seizing it, placed the silver mouthpiece
to my lips; then I blew. I blew
till the rafters rang and the ceiling shook.
I paused, then again I blew. I was
drunk, and mad, mad&mdash;with the madness of
battle. I left the room. The soul of the
trumpet seemed to have possessed me, the
mad sound of the trumpet beaten back from
the walls drove me onwards. Through the
corridor, down the great staircase, across
the hall, then back up the staircase, along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the corridor to my room I passed, the
whole house ringing to the sound of the
silver trumpet.</p>

<p>Then I found myself lying on my bedroom
floor, sick, faint, and covered with a
cold perspiration. The trumpet lay beside
me. Away upstairs I thought I heard
frightened cries, and the banging of a door,
then silence. I crawled to the bed. I
could scarcely drag my body on to it, my
exhaustion was so great. Then I fell into
a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE RUBY WINE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Oh</span>, the dismal dawn that woke me, it came
through the window that I had left wide open.
I sat up in bed. I was still dressed. My
spurs had torn the coverlet, the trumpet and
its blood-red silken cord lay upon the floor.
The wind blew in, shaking the curtains
mournfully. I saw it all at a glance. I
remembered everything&mdash;the trumpeter had
returned. Oh, it was awful, that moment
of cringing terror. It seemed as if fate had
been crawling at me slowly during the last
three days. It seemed as if last night she
had made a fearful bound, and now, like
a tiger, was crouching for the final spring.</p>

<p>I had done it with my own lips, I had
blown the death-trumpet for Geraldine. And
now that voice came back that I heard at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
first, saying, "Remember, Geraldine is a
boy." Ah, yes, I remembered it now, now
that I had heralded to Geraldine the fate
to which all the eldest boys of the Wilder
family were doomed.</p>

<p>I threw myself face down on the pillows,
weeping as if my heart would break; but of
what use were tears? I had elected to play
the part of a man, tears were out of place.
I stopped weeping and dried my eyes.
<i>What</i> was to be done? how could I save
this child?</p>

<p>"Only one way," said a voice in my head,
"leave her&mdash;you alone can kill her, so leave
her."</p>

<p>I would,&mdash;I would leave her. I determined
on that and rose from the bed; but, oh God
help me, I determined to go first to her to say
good-bye. Was it wrong? ask it of yourself.
How&mdash;how could I leave this child, whose
life was dearer to me than my own, how could
I leave her without saying good-bye? Do you
know what it means to leave a person you
love, to leave for ever without saying good-bye?
Could a mother leave her infant never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to see it again without first kissing its tiny
hands, its lips, its eyes? I could have torn
my heart out with my own hands, but I
could not have left Geraldine without saying
good-bye.</p>

<p>I came to the great pier-glass and I saw
myself&mdash;the cavalier. I leaned my head
against it and against his, and I gazed out
of the window at the dull grey sky; still
another day of the damp, dark, sorrowful
weather. The clock on the mantel pointed
to the hour&mdash;quarter to six.</p>

<p>"I shall kiss her once and say good-bye
and leave her for ever," I murmured to
myself, but the words seemed to have little
meaning. "I shall go to her now," I said,
standing upright and addressing my own
reflection in the glass, "for the sooner it is
over the better."</p>

<p>I left the room. The passage was dark,
but I felt my way with my hand. Down the
stairs I came, across the hall, down the
little corridor. I lifted the curtain and
knocked. "Come in," said a voice.</p>

<p>She was not asleep, then. I opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
door. Geraldine was sitting by the open
window, dressed; she had not been to bed.
The bed lay white&mdash;Oh, God, if these
tears would only choke me and not fill my
throat with this dull, heavy pain&mdash;white
and uncrumpled. She stretched out her
arms to me feebly and as if against her
will. And now I had kissed her three times,
and was kneeling by her side, I&mdash;who had
determined to kiss her once and leave her&mdash;and
her head was upon my shoulder, and
she was telling me how she could not go
to bed for thinking of me, and how she
loved me, loved me as no one had ever
been loved before. Oh the innocence and
divine sweetness of this love, of this voice,
and the terror and anguish of the thought,
"You are doomed to kill her, doomed,
doomed."</p>

<p>How could I leave her? She had actually
put her arm round my neck. I laid my
head behind hers, so that I might not see
the dawn, and might forget the world. My
lips kept murmuring, "It is fate." As if in
answer to the muttering of my lips there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
came a sound, the turret clock was striking
six, six melancholy strokes; they brought
back to my mind the words of the little
black book.</p>

<p>"Geraldine," I cried, holding my face on
her knees, "it was this hour, long, long ago,
when I killed you; tell me to go, tell me to
leave you, it will happen again, for Death
is here, oh! <i>listen</i> to the wind." I ceased,
and the wind sobbed and sighed in the
garden, but no word came from Geraldine,
only a tear that fell and burned my hand.
"Geraldine," I whispered, "I have betrayed
you, turn me away for your own sake."</p>

<p>Then I felt two soft hands seize my hair
on either side of my head, and lift my face.
I heard a voice whisper, "You are mine, and
I will hold you so."</p>

<p>"Ah! then," I cried, "let the past be gone
for ever; now, now with this kiss&mdash;and this&mdash;and
this&mdash;let us defy Death." But even as
our lips clung together, the wind moaned
drearily in the trees. I heard Death, I felt
him, he was in the garden, his gray misty
face was at the window. We clung to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
other like people drowning; we seemed to
know that the eternal parting was so near;
speechless, with lips paralysed, but still pressed
together, we seemed listening for help, but no
help came, nor sound&mdash;only the sound of the
wind mourning in the trees.</p>

<p>Then drearily a little bird began to sing
somewhere in the garden. Its song pierced my
wretched heart and drove me to madness, to
passion. I stood up, and, as my arms were
round her, I lifted her in my arms. For one
moment I held that delightful burthen, so
warm and supple and perfumed, then growing
dizzy, I laid her on the bed and leaned
beside her. She started and drew back from
something she saw in my gaze. Her lips
grew pale.</p>

<p>"Geraldine," I muttered, "what is the
matter, <i>Geraldine</i>?"</p>

<p>The pale lips moved, and a terror shot
through me. She was going to faint; no, she
was not going to faint, she seemed recovered
now, but how weak she seemed.</p>

<p>"Wait," I whispered to her, "wait till
I come back."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>I left the room and hurried across the
hall to the dining-room. Here, on the sideboard
was a lock-up case containing brandy
and liqueurs, but it was locked, of course;
here was a decanter labelled "Roussillon."
That would do.</p>

<p>I took a wine-glass and the decanter, and
returned.</p>

<p>Geraldine, when she saw the decanter,
shook her head, just as children shake
their heads at the medicine bottle. But
I was firm, and poured out a glass of
the ruby wine. I put my hand behind
her head and told her she must drink,
drink it right off. She did as she was
bid, and made a face; she said it was,
bitter, and I said "Nonsense." Then her
eyes became sleepy, and she lay with them
fixed on mine; then her eyelids began to
droop with sleep. Oh, how jealous I felt
of sleep. And now I could not see her
eyes at all. She was breathing deeply,
and her lips now and then gave a little
twitch. I sat holding her hand and stroking
it. I sat for twenty minutes watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
her. How light her breathing had suddenly
become, and now suddenly she caught her
breath and smiled as if she beheld some
one in her dreams. I heard the galloping
of a horse from the avenue, but I did not
heed.</p>

<p>I waited for the next breath, but it never
came. The smile had parted her lips, but
she did not breathe; the eyelids lifted a
tiny bit, but the eyes did not seem to
see.</p>

<p>I said "Geraldine." No answer.</p>

<p>What was that furious ringing of bells,
and that thundering as at a door? I
heard it, but never heeded.</p>

<p>"Geraldine, Geraldine," I whispered.
"Geraldine, wake, I am waiting for
you." No answer, but the sound of the
wind wailing in the trees.</p>

<p>She never moved, the smile on her face
never changed. I sobbed. I turned round.
Wilder was entering the room, he had
just arrived. When he saw me dressed as
I was he threw up his hands. He did not
look at the form on the bed; he looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the decanter, he smelt the glass, and he
gave a little senile, dreary kind of laugh.
He pointed to it and made a motion as
if drinking. I knew what he meant,&mdash;it
was one of his opium decanters mislabled
Roussillon.</p>

<p>Then he sat down by the form on the
bed, with his hands on his knees and his
head bowed, and I heard him murmuring
the words "My child."</p>

<p>The turret clock struck seven; with the
last stroke I heard the shrill neigh of a
horse, and the sound of a hoof striking
sharply on granite.</p>

<p>It was as if to say: the play is ended,
the curtain has fallen, never, never to rise
again.</p>

<small>"AND THEY LAID HIM TO HIS REST"</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I remember</span> next being in my own bedroom.
I was taking off the cavalier's dress,
and I felt like a traveller who had returned
from some far and beautiful land. I never
wept, nor even sighed. And I remember
the rest of that strange and ghostly day, the
silence of the house, and the room beyond
the pretty corridor that held a thing
stranger than anything on earth or in the
sea. It rained slightly towards dusk. I was
looking out of a window on to the garden,
later&mdash;it may have been midnight for aught
I know, I came down the painted corridor,
and entered the bedroom. A lamp was burning,
and on the bed lay something small and
straight, covered with a sheet. I drew away
the sheet, and saw the face I had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
so well; just the same it looked, only
smaller and more helpless, and the smile
had faded away into a vague, beseeching
look.</p>

<p>Then I remember days that passed, and
one day when Wilder said to me, "You will
not come?" "Where?" I asked. "To
the graveyard."</p>

<p>I was in the library when he spoke. I
shook my head.</p>

<p>He left the room; and a little later I
heard heavy footsteps, and the tolling of
a bell in the distance. I counted, one, two,
three&mdash;sixteen, then the bell ceased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little falcon came back last night. It
has been weeks away, but it came back last
night, and I feel it even now pinching at
my wrist. It seems to say, "Hurry, you
have nearly finished." It seems anxious for
me to go with it. Where? I do not know.</p>

<p>I can scarcely write. I am half-blind
with what? God only knows. Not tears, for
I have no tears left. A darkness has stolen
over my brain. In writing this story I
have drawn the past up to me like an unwilling
ghost: I have kissed it on the forehead,
mouth, and eyes, and now that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

<p>They have buried Geraldine. Not in the

<p>I am not afraid to die; in fact, if I could
be glad about anything, I should now be
glad. Death seems to me such a little
withered, contemptible figure, for ever jealous
of Love&mdash;yet sometimes death seems to me
like a white marble portico, seen down an
alley of cypress trees, under a sky all dark
with autumn.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
